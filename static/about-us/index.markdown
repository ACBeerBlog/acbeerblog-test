The ACBB was launched by Greg Delaney in January 2012 as part of a [New Year's Resolution](http://acbeerblog.ca/2012/01/01/ive-made-a-new-years-resolution-to-create-a-blog-focused-on-atlantic-canadian-beer/). Greg wanted a way to share the local beer news, and the stories of the people behind it, with the rest of the world. With multiple posts each week, and insightful interviews and posts, Greg spread the word about great beer far and wide.

After a year of hard work, Greg [handed off the blog](http://acbeerblog.ca/2013/01/01/introducing-the-two-new-bloggers-for-the-atlantic-canada-beer-blog/) to Chris McDonald, to spend more of his (too little) free time homebrewing. Chris is an avid homebrewer, BJCP Certified judge, and really handsome. After quickly realizing that keeping up on all of the news solo was a fool's errand, Chris roped in fellow homebrewer and beer lover Shawn Meek (also quite handsome himself). Since then, Chris, in Halifax, and Shawn, in Fredericton, have been continuing the work that Greg started, with the goal of sharing the latest and greatest news of the ever-growing beer scene in Atlantic Canada. Since the launch in 2012, the number of breweries in Atlantic Canada has more than tripled, and shows no sign of slowing down. In late 2016, Shawn and Chris roped in fellow beer-crazy guy Aaron Spanik (also a looker, of course!) to help lighten the load. With over 80 breweries in Atlantic Canada, there's plenty of news to go around!

The guys have also done some writing outside of the blog, and have been published in newspapers and magazines. Beer tastings, beer trivia, do some consulting, and are generally awesome guys. Fire them an [email](mailto:ACBeerBlog@gmail.com) or use the [Contact page](http://acbeerblog.ca/contact/) to get in touch. Cheers!
