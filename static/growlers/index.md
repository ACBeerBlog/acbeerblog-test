title: Growler Fills in Atlantic Canada - Locations, Policies, and Cleaning
wordpress_id: 7836

Growlers are a popular way to take away beer from your favourite brewery, brewpub, or private beer store. The most popular format is the 1.89 litre (64 ounce) glass container, though they can be found in other sizes (.75 - 2.0 litre) and materials (stainless steel, ceramic). As every brewery sets its own policies for growlers, we wanted to collect them all in one list.
Please note that this information was accurate at the time of publishing, and if you've noticed something is incorrect, we'd love to update it. Fire us an email at [ACBeerBlog@gmail.com](mailto:ACBeerBlog@gmail.com). Thanks!

Growler maintenance and cleaning is key to enjoying your beer. Here are some guidelines for maintaining your growlers:
1) Once filled, keep your growler cool and out of light, like your fridge or cooler. Enjoy it within a few days of filling, and within a few hours of opening, to ensure carbonation is ideal.
2) As soon as empty, thoroughly rinse the growler with hot water.
3) Dry the growler upside-down, allowing all water to drain. Recycle the cap, you'll get a new one at the brewery. (Alternatively, store it filled with some no-rinse sanitizer solution like StarSan to keep it nasty-free until filling)
4) Return for refill or exchange.

_If you've let a growler dry with beer in it, and/or it is visibly dirty, soak it in a hot PBW or scent-free Oxiclean solution overnight, and start again from step 2. Do not use soap, as it can interfere with beer foam and head retention._

A brewery's main job is to make great beer and get it into your hands, not to clean glassware. They have the right to refuse to fill, exchange, or reimburse a truly dirty growler, so please keep them clean!
