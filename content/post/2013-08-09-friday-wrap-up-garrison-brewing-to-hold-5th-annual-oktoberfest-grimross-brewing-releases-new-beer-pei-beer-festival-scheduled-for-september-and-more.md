Good morning, fellow craft beer lovers!

• This September 21st, [Garrison Brewing Co.](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/), in collaboration with the [German Canadian Association](http://www.germancanadianassociation.ca/), will be holding their 5th annual [Halifax Oktoberfest](http://hfxoktoberfest.ca/). There will be lots of German food, live music, and Garrison beer and [Stutz](http://www.stutzcider.com/) cider available. The celebrations will be spread out over the day in two sessions: a free, market-wide afternoon session, and a 19+ evening session beginning at 7:00 pm. Tickets for the evening event will be $12 ($11 for students/military), and can be purchased at the Garrison retail store, or the day-of at the location at [Pavilion 20](http://www.halifaxseaport.com/tenant-directory/pavilion-twenty.html) downtown. We'll have a more-thorough post on this soon!

• The number of beers available from [Grimross Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) in Fredericton continues to grow. Joining the Cheval D'Or and Destrier Farmhouse Stout is Ben's Bitter Pale Ale, a Belgian Pale Ale with slightly more bittering hops, according to owner/brewer Stephen Dixon. With healthy doses of Cascade hops for bittering and flavor, and Saaz hops for aroma, Ben's Bitter will come across as quite floral, with earthy and citrus-fruit tones, and a lasting bitterness in the finish. Currently available in refillable growlers at the [Picaroons Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133), and hopefully on tap in the area soon.

• With the [Seaport Beer Festival](http://www.seaportbeerfest.com/) happening this weekend in Halifax, it's time to start planning for the next beer fest... the [Prince Edward Island Beer Festival](http://www.fallflavours.ca/calendar/56/2182-PEI-International-Beer-Festival) will occur the first full weekend in September, Friday the 6th and Saturday the 7th. Last year, there were two beer festivals in PEI within a month of one another; the province decided in the spring to allow only one festival this year. Details are a bit slim right now, but we'll do a post on the event as soon as we learn more. We can report that there will be over 75 different beers available, from breweries such as [Amsterdam](http://amsterdambeer.com/), [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/), [McAuslan](http://mcauslan.com/en/), [Hop City](http://www.hopcity.com/), and [Erdinger](http://www.erdinger.de/age.php?r=L2VuL2VyZGluZ2VyLXdlaXNzYmllci1jb21wYW55L2JyZXdlcnkuaHRtbA==&l=en). There are several tasting sessions planned; ticket prices range from $20-$120, depending on the session. You can follow the event on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/peibeerfest) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PEIbeerfest) for up-to-date notifications.

• Not satisfied with only growler fills of [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) beer? Looking to get more than pint pours at Halifax bars? Well, you're in luck... they are now offering 19.5 L party kegs for sale, for all beers that are available at the time. There is a $100 refundable keg deposit, and pricing will be $105 for the Gus or Summer Ale, $110 for the Farmhouse, and $120 for the Strong Dark (taxes not included). Call ahead to order yours!

• Greg Nash is tapping a few special beers at [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) in Halifax today, starting at 4:00 p.m. Accompanying a few of their regular-release beers will be "X", an Imperial Brown Ale aged 18 months on cedar wood (11% ABV); "Vintage Wreckoning", a Russian Imperial Stout on nitro, fortified with Macallan single malt whiskey (11% ABV); the regular "Wreckoning" RIS (10.5% ABV); the popular "Oaked-Aged Double Hoppelganger" DIPA (10% ABV); and "Barrel-Aged Desecration", an Imperial Red Ale (11% ABV). Some nice sessionable (!) beers for your weekend! Get down to the Rockbottom ASAP - these beers will only be on tap until Sunday close.

• And, in case that's not enough big beers for you, the [Hart & Thistle](http://www.hartandthistle.com/) will be putting on [Nashfest](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2013/08/nashfest-h-aug-9th-11th.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) again, with several OTHER Greg Nash beers for you to enjoy! These include "Columbus DIPA", single-hopped with Columbus (9.1% ABV); "Commissar", a Russian Imperial Stout, this time fortified with Bulleit bourbon (11% ABV); "Hop Mess Monster v3.0", another DIPA single-hopped with Columbus (10% ABV); "Old 87", an American IPA with lots of Columbus and Falconer's Flight hops (7% ABV); and "Kneecapper", an India Red Ale, or "Red IPA" with plenty of... yep, hops (6.1% ABV). It all starts at 4:00 p.m. today, and ends at close on Sunday.

• [Uncle Leo's Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/UncleLeosBrewery) may have just opened not too long ago in Pictou, NS, but their beers have already made it to Halifax! Both their Red Ale and IPA became available in 650 mL bombers at [Premier Wine & Spirits](http://premierwines.ca/store/) earlier this week. Premier doesn't expect them to last long, so get in while you can.

• Looks like [Barnone Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) in PEI has started filling growlers. You can drop by the brewery in Rose Valley every Thursday between 6:00 and 8:00 pm; both their Pale Ale and Summer Sessions will be available for fills.

• [Sea Level Brewing](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) has extended the hours of their retail store, where you can stock up on their canned beer, as well as 1-L refillable growlers. Their official hours are now Monday-Friday 10 am-6 pm, Saturday 10 am-5 pm, and Sunday 12 pm-5 pm.

That's it for this week... have a safe and beery weekend!
