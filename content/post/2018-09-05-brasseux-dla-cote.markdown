I see no twitter or IG yet.

**Chris has added pictures to the Media page so they can be dropped in as necessary, in case this comes together while he's away.**



A Tracadie-Sheila Microbrewery Co-op started several years ago, with 200 members. That allowed them to purchase a small 300 litre (2.5 BBL) pilot system for recipe development. They have perfected the recipes, and have moved up to a 1200 litre (10BBL) brewhouse from [Criveller](http://www.criveller.com/products/brewing/) in Niagara Falls.

Jason Haché is the Brewmaster, and he took time to answer our questions.





- Can you tell us a little bit about yourselves?

- How did you get into the world of beer?

- What made you decide to take the step into opening a brewery?

- What is the culture or ethos of the brewery?

- Do you have an approximate opening date?

- Can you tell us about the beers you plan on offering initially? Any seasonals or one-offs in the works?

- What are your plans for distribution? Taproom, keg licensees, bottles, growlers, etc.? Will you be licensed for on-site sales or consumption at the brewery?

- Do you have some initial accounts in the area lined up to serve your beers?

- Have you had any assistance from other breweries/people in Atlantic Canada (or elsewhere)?

- Where do you hope to see your brewery in the next 2-3 years?

Brewer/Brewery specific:

- What size/manufacturer/type of system are you be brewing on? Expected output (monthly, yearly, etc)?

- Care to share some info on your homebrewing history (if applicable)?

- Do you have a favorite beer style, beer, or brewery you enjoy drinking?

- How about favourite style or ingredient to brew with?


- Do you have a website, facebook, instagram, and/or twitter page?


If you have a high quality logo, and any pictures of the brewery, system, etc, we'd love to include them in the post.



We also maintain a Growler page for the region (http://acbeerblog.ca/growlers/), would you be able to answer these questions regarding growler sales?

What size growler(s) do you offer for sale/fills?

Are growler glass bottles offered for sale, or refundable deposits?

Are there any restrictions on type or origin of growlers (only fill/exchange your own, or do not fill 1L flip-tops, etc)?







Anything else you'd like to share, we'd love pass it along.
