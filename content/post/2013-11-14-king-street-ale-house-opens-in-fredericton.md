After months of waiting, residents of Fredericton (and beyond) can breathe a sigh of relief - the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/), the newest restaurant/beer bar in the city, has finally opened! Yesterday afternoon (November 13th), the doors were opened to the public for the first time.

Located at 546 King St. in downtown Fredericton, the restaurant is owned by Doug Williams and Shane Fraser. Doug and Shane previously owned a popular restaurant in Fredericton that was [closed due to a fire](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/garrison-district-ale-house-in-fredericton-damaged-by-fire/) in early January; in many ways, the KSAH is an improvement on that location, with a bigger menu, more seating, and most importantly... more beer!

SPEAKING of beer, the KSAH will definitely not disappoint. The tap selection is one of the largest in Fredericton, with 24 draught lines, featuring lots of local beers including [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307), [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) (with an exclusive beer brewed just for the KSAH, a Smoked Porter called "Ember Ale") and [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/), along with other Canadian breweries, such as [Unibroue](http://www.unibroue.com/) and [McAuslan](http://mcauslan.com/en/). Throw in several European offerings ([Delirium Tremens](http://www.delirium.be/), Mort Subite Kriek, and [Erdinger](http://www.erdinger.de/age.php?r=L2VuL2VyZGluZ2VyLXdlaXNzYmllci1jb21wYW55L2JyZXdlcnkuaHRtbA==&l=en) Weissbier, to name a few), and you've got a lot of great beer on tap!

What about the bottle selection? Yeah, you'll probably like that, too. Featuring over 140 different beers from all over the world (heavy emphasis on Canada, the U.S., and Europe, of course), many are beers that you normally can't find in New Brunswick. With styles ranging from English Bitters to Imperial IPAs to Schwarzbier, the only problem beer drinkers will have is deciding WHICH beer(s) to order.

The large menu looks fantastic as well, with a strong emphasis on barbecue. The KSAH has a new smoker capable of smoking up to 240 lbs of beef, pork, chicken, and cheese... and more!

I think it goes without saying that we're very happy that Doug and Shane are back with another beer bar/restaurant for Fredericton, and wish them the best of luck with their new location! Follow the KSAH on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KingStreetAle) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kingstreetalehouse) for beer and menu updates. Their hours are 11:30 am - 12:00 am Monday to Wednesday, 11:30 am - 1:00 am Thursday, and 11:30 am - 2:00 am Friday and Saturday (closed Sundays).
