Happy Friday everyone, another big week in craft beer in our region, so let's get right to it.

• Last month, [we reported on](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/04/11/friday-wrap-up-20140411/) the announcement of a collaboration beer between [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) and Toronto's [Great Lakes Brewery](http://www.greatlakesbeer.com/) for this year's [Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) in Fredericton. We now have a few more details on the beer, as both breweries just brewed the beer earlier this week. Brewers Andrew Estabrooks (Picaroons) and Mike Lackey (Great Lakes) decided on an [American IPA](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style14.php#1b) they've named _Eastbound and Down IPA_; it's brewed with Maritime Malt made from New Brunswick-grown Newdale barley and "a number of delicious hop varieties" (including Citra and Sorachi Ace) often featured in Great Lakes beers. We can also confirm that a [California Common](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style07.php#1b) yeast was pitched for fermentation, rather than the Ringwood strain commonly employed by Picaroons. Both breweries were linked via Skype on their brew day since they weren't able to physically brew together. Look for the beer to be released at the end of May when the CBAs are here; it will be available for growler fills at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf), and in restaurants and bars in the area.

• Speaking of Picaroons, they're joining up with [The Shadow Lawn Inn](http://shadowlawninn.com/welcome.html) in Rothesay, NB for a special beer-pairing dinner on Saturday, May 3rd. This ["Offaly Good Dinner"](http://shadowlawninn.com/an-offaly-good-dinner-with-picaroons.html) includes six carefully-selected courses by Chef Markian, each of which is paired with a different hand-picked Picaroons beer. Tickets are $75 (tax and gratuity included); call (506) 847-7539 to reserve, or send them an [email](mailto:inquiries<at>shadowlawninn.com).

• If you're in the Sackville area today and have always wondered what makes [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) beers tick, now's your chance to find out! Ducky's Bar is hosting a "Meet & Greet" with PEIBC brewer Karen Allen at 5:00 pm. Karen will be on hand for about an hour to answer questions and provide info on their beers, four of which will be on tap: _Blueberry Ale_, _Sir John A's Honey Wheat_, _Cole's Cream Ale_, and _Beach Chair Lager_. Be sure to keep an eye on their [News page](http://peibrewingcompany.com/news/) for behind-the-scenes updates directly from the brewers.

• Beginning today, [White Point Beach Resort](https://www.facebook.com/whitepointbeachresort)  is hosting a [Beer and BBQ weekend](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153984665935510&set=gm.1463773497190015&type=1&theater). [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) and [Hell Bay](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) will be taking over White Point's taps all weekend long, with Boxing Rock bringing their _Hunky Dory_, _Temptation Red Ale_ and _The Vicar's Cross _ and seasonals _Crafty Jack English Ale_ and _Alewife's Revenge_, and Hell Bay will have three more beers to complete the lineup. Boxing Rock is kicking off the fun Saturday afternoon at 1:00, with a guided tasting and virtual brewery tour. At 4pm, Hell Bay and the White Point culinary team will be doing some pairing of their beer with barbecued treats. Both tastings are included with an overnight stay.

• Progress continues at the soon-to-open [Railcar Brewing Company](http://railcarbrewing.com/) in Florenceville-Bristol, as owner/brewer Mitch Biggar has confirmed that he has been busy putting on the final touches - cleaning, painting, sanitizing, and receiving new equipment, with currently eight 50-gallon (~187 L) fermentors being installed. With some test batches being brewed this weekend, we hope to see the brewery open for growler fills by the end of this month! Look for a grand-opening party to follow shortly thereafter, probably sometime in the summer.

• Living in Moncton? If so, you've probably been drinking [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) _Belgian Rye IPA_ at the [Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) over the past few months. If that has left you wanting more Grimross beer, good news... owner/brewer Stephen Dixon confirmed that he has delivered some of his _Pugnacious Porter_, a 5% Belgian-style Porter conditioned on pure cocoa and whole vanilla beans, to the Tide & Boar this week, so look for it soon.

• The [Rockbottom](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) Brewpub SMaSH India Pale Lager that we [mentioned in late March](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/friday-wrap-up-4/) has been tapped at the brewpub in Halifax. Brewed solely with Superior Pale Ale Malt and Galaxy hops (including multiple dry-hop additions),_ Intergalactic SMaSH'd Lager_ finished at 7.1% ABV and 70 IBUs (calc). Get down to the brewpub to give it a try, it won't be around for long!

• A reminder that [The Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) is keeping up their Cask Friday event, when they have a special beer tapped each Friday at 4pm. This week's  is [Big Spruce's](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) _Cereal Killer Sideways_, their Oatmeal Stout, fortified with [Glenmorangie](http://www.glenmorangie.com/) Single Malt Scotch.

• [The Chronicle Herald](http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/1203766-bad-apple-gets-good-reaction-to-homestyle-brewing) has a nice article about Jeff and Kari of [Bad Apple Brewhouse](https://www.facebook.com/badapplebrewhouse), on their history, as well plans for the future. It also mentions an upcoming _Mosaic Double IPA_, which will be released around Father's Day, that will serve as a fundraiser towards the [Brigadoon Children’s Camp Society](http://www.brigadoonvillage.org/). We'll have more details on the beer closer to release time.

In closing, we thought we should mention another [story](http://thechronicleherald.ca/canada/1203870-runaway-beer-blimp-found-tangled-in-trees#.U1_b8IJyS2k.twitter) reported by The Chronicle Herald concerning a 21-metre [Labatt](http://www.labatt.com/?language=en) blimp that crashed northeast of Saint John. Nice to see that Big Beer is finally starting to evacuate Atlantic Canada, what with the increasing number and quality of local craft breweries!
