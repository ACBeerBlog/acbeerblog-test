Happy Friday everyone! In case you thought last week's busy post was a fluke, fear not! It's been another busy week in Atlantic Canadian Beer News. And that means more tasty bevvies out now, and cool events coming our way! Let's get right to the action!

• [Paddys Irish Brewpubs](%20http://www.paddyspub.ca/) in Kentville and Wolfville have a few new beers on tap that are worth checking out! First up is their _Extra Special Bitter_, weighing in at 5.5% ABV and 30 IBUs. It's brewed with a traditional English malt bill and English Ale yeast for a light caramel character, and traditional **East Kent Goldings** hops exclusively give a light bitterness and a taste of England in the Annapolis Valley. Their _Irish Stout_ is also on tap, an easily sessionable, light-bodied beer, but with a roast-forward character. This beer weighs in at 5% ABV and 33 IBUs, and is a fan favourite. Also keep an eye out for two lagers to be making their debut at the pubs in the next while: a _Helles_, which incorporated step mashing on their full 7 barrel system (sounds like quite a task!), and a Red Lager. We'll have more details on both when they are available.

• There's lots going on at [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) these days! First off, they just sent over a new cask to [Bar Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) in Halifax: _Rais'n Sais'n_ is a bit of an experiment, consisting of their_ Iron Bridge Brown Ale_ fermented with a Saison yeast ([Belle Saison](http://www.danstaryeast.com/products/belle-saison-beer-yeast), from Danstar, the same strain used in last year's _Lobster Saison_). The beer was then transferred to a cask with a quantity of sultana raisins (a sweet, golden-coloured variety); it comes in at 5.1% ABV. Get down to Stillwell to try a pour before it's gone!

• Moving on, they've also brewed a new Saison. Currently unnamed, it's a completely different brew from the_ Lobster Saison_. Brewed with all 2-row malt and hopped with** Saaz** and **UK Goldings**, it was then fermented "very warm" with the Belgian [Dupont](http://www.brasserie-dupont.com/Dupont/Default.aspx?Lang=en&page=home) yeast strain from [White Labs](http://www.whitelabs.com/). With this yeast, expect lots of spicy flavors and aromas, accompanied by some fruitiness and a dry finish. The beer should be hitting taps at select locations sometime early next month; we'll be sure to keep you updated on its release.

• Finally, a bit of a teaser: PEIBC brewmaster Chris Long has confirmed that we can expect to see a series of small batch (8 bbl) single-hop beers this summer at the brewery tasting room, and at [Fishbones Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill](http://fishbones.ca/) in Charlottetown. We look forward to hearing more about this series when better weather arrives!

• Moving on to the [Gahan](http://www.gahan.ca/) side of PEIBC, they've released a new beer just in time for the Island's annual (and extremely popular) [PEI Burger Love](http://peiburgerlove.ca/). Angus Pale is a single-hop APA featuring the fairly-new **Belma** variety, and fermented with an English yeast strain. The beer is lightly filtered, with a "slight citrus aroma and a fruity/berry-like finish", according to the brewery,

• It's time to join the Club! Ahead of their opening later this Spring, [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/) have announced the details of their Club, available at launch. There are three levels available to those able to get in: The first level is an annual membership ($250 for the first year, $175 to resubscribe, plus HST), which gets the member an Unfiltered-branded Stainless Steel growler (full of beer, of course!), plus another free fill on their birthday (and $1 off all subsequent growler fills Mon-Wed), a branded glass and limited edition t-shirt, a pair of bottles of Russian Imperial Stouts (perfect for cellaring), and early access and first right of refusal to subsequent releases and swag. The second level is a _lifetime_ membership in the Club, with all of its benefits, but with an even better growler. The cost to enroll is $1000 (plus tax). The third level is $5000, and is identical to the second level, but will offer the member the opportunity to brew a beer with Brewmaster Greg Nash, and leave with 20 litres of it after your hard day(s) of work. Full details on the Club, including how to sign up, are available [here](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/2015/04/the-resurrection-is-over-now-join-a-cult-that-actually-does-something-for-you/), and we're happy to report that their brewhouse from [DME](http://www.dmebrewing.ca/) was delivered this week, which means it won't be long until the brewing begins!

• [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) has brewed a new beer, and it's their first collaboration! Staying true to their roots, they formulated a recipe with two homebrewers from the [New Brunswick Craft Brewers Association](http://nbcba.org/forum/), Adam Jones and Roger Ringuette. The beer, _Sensible Nonsense_, is a DIPA hopped with **Apollo**, **Magnum**, **Orbit**, **Centennial**, and **Mosaic**, to approximately 95 IBUs. Supported by some malty sweetness thanks to some Vienna and CaraRed malt in the mash, expect this hoppy beer to exhibit lots of fruity, piney, and dank notes. It should come in around 7.5% ABV; look for it to hit taps around Fredericton within the next couple of weeks. They're also planning on experimenting with some casks of this beer, so stay tuned for that (and remember, their inaugural cask release at the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) starts tonight at 6 pm!).

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) released a new experimental beer earlier this week, an unnamed "Belgian Scotch Ale". Definitely a bit of an orphan beer, think of it as a low-ABV Scotch Ale (featuring Roasted, Crystal, and Smoked malts) fermented with a Belgian Ardennes yeast strain, and hopped with **Goldings** and **Fuggles**. The beer came about from two batches of another experiment, a stronger Scotch Ale, where the weaker run-offs of each batch were combined for this release. The stronger batches were combined and are now being aged for a future release (and possibly some barrel-aging). Coming in at around 4.5% ABV, it features lots of clove and banana aromas and flavors, in conjunction with the smokiness and sweetness from the malt, according to the brewery. It's on tap now, exclusively at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf) for growler fills.

• For this year's [Earth Day](http://www.earthday.ca/) (April 22nd), the [Lion & Bright](http://lionandbright.com/) is once again celebrating with [Spruce up the Planet!](https://www.facebook.com/events/1589581171298476/), a [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) tap takeover. Doors open at 7 pm (the $7 charge will go to the [Ecology Action Centre](https://www.ecologyaction.ca/) (EAC) to support their Ocean's Week activities), and there will be live music from The Bluejam Grass Band, as well as "Love Letters to the Ocean", hosted by [Brave Space](https://www.facebook.com/BraveSpace?fref=ts). For every pint purchased, an additional $1 will be donated to the EAC. Unfortunately, we don't have a full tap list for you, but we're pretty sure you won't be disappointed with the selection!

• There's yet another beer event planned for Fredericton from those behind the [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/). [Let Them Eat Cake... and Drink Beer](https://www.facebook.com/events/832005420223286/) will pair six different [La Naufrageur](http://www.lenaufrageur.com/) beers (each pour is 8 oz) with six cake varieties from local bakery [Fuller Confections](https://www.facebook.com/FullerConfections). Scheduled for Saturday, April 25th at 2 pm at the King Street Ale House, it's going to be a small event, with entry being limited to ten people. Tickets are $25 each and can be purchased by sending an [email](mailto:frederictonbeer<at>gmail.com). This is the first of several planned small-pairings; stay tuned for more in the near future!

• Now seems like a good time to mention that the fourth [Burgers n' Beer](https://www.facebook.com/events/373491619526748/) has been planned for Tuesday, June 9th, from 8:00 - 10:30 pm. Held once again at the uptown [reLiSH](http://relishyou.ca/) location, this event is taking on a new twist, featuring an "Ales vs. Lagers" approach. Breweries are currently TBD, but count on six beers (8 oz pours) to be paired with six different reLiSH sliders. It's a great way to kick off the two-week **Fredericton Burger Battle** (part of [Eat New Brunswick](https://www.facebook.com/thefrederictonburgerbattle?fref=ts)), which begins on June 8th.(Tickets are $48 each, and are available [online](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/burgers-n-beer-fredericton-40-tickets-15450525939). We'll have more info on the breweries participating, soon.

• [Sea Level Brewing](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) is bringing back their latest seasonal, _Düssel-port Altbier_. This "New World [Alt](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style07.php#1c)" uses a recipe given to Brewmaster Randy Lawrence by a brewer friend from [Brauerei im Füchschen](http://www.fuechschen.de/), in Dusseldorf, home of the Alt style. This medium-bodied ale weighs in at 4.8% ABV. Lawrence used **Saphir** hops throughout, for an authentic bitterness. It is now available at the brewery in cans, growlers, and kegs, and on tap at the [Port Pub](http://theportpub.com/) and other locations shortly.

• Last month, [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) brewed up a collaboration brew with the [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/): the _Cinnamon Spin_. While the poor weather kept the LBL crew away, they were there in spirit, and the crew visiting from [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com/) lent a hand in their stead. We now have some information on the beer, and the release details! The base beer is a Robust Porter, weighing in at 6.5% ABV. It featured some first wort hopping, and whole cinnamon sticks added during the boil. Now the important details: how can you taste it? The Ladies Beer League and Boxing Rock folks will be launching the beer April 18th at Bar Stillwell in Halifax. It is an open event, no tickets required, and pay as you enjoy, starting at 6pm. There will be a cask of the _Cinnamon Spin_ tapped at 6:30, and the beer will also be available on tap. There will also be LBL swag and memberships available for purchase that evening. Stillwell will have exclusivity on the kegged beer, but there will be some bottles available at the B.R. brewery, Seaport and Alderney Farmers Markets, and the private beer stores in HRM. As the beer was brewed in celebration of [International Women's Day](http://www.internationalwomensday.com/), there are two charities benefiting from sales of the beer: [Halifax Sexual Health Center](http://www.hshc.ca/) and [Shelburne County Women’s Fishnet Bursary Program](https://www.facebook.com/ShelburneCountyWomensFishnet).

• And speaking of beer launches at Stillwell, the next Saturday, April 25th, will see the launch party of the third in the line of [Propeller Brewing'](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/)s _Lambic_-style beers. This release will be different than the earlier two, in that there was no fruit added during the fermentation and maturation process (raspberries and blackberries were featured previously); this will be the straight wheat beer that was inoculated with wild yeast and bacteria and aged in [Blomidon Estate](http://blomidonwine.ca/) oak barrels, to produce a unique beer not otherwise available in our region. Think of it as a 4.2% ABV [Gueuze](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style17.php#1e)-style beer, though this will be an unblended 4-year old beer. As in previous releases, the beer will be available by the glass and in bottles (for consumption at the bar) beginning at noon. There will be a signup sheet on site for those who would like to purchase one bottle (and one bottle only) from Propeller the next day, ahead of the general sale on Monday. The last release was so popular that none of the beer made it to Monday, all was scooped up in pre-sales, and we imagine the same will happen again this time. More details on the beer can be seen in a [previous post](http://acbeerblog.ca/2014/08/08/friday-wrap-up-20140808/) on the first release.

• Details for the [Beerthief](http://www.beerthief.ca/) **Ancient Ales** tasting in St John's are now available, being held at [The Bella Vista](http://www.bellavista.ca/), at 5pm Saturday, May 2nd. Dr. Patrick McGovern, a[ biomolecular archaeologist](http://www.penn.museum/sites/biomoleculararchaeology/?page_id=10),  will be giving a presentation on the fieldwork and research required to develop the [Dogfish Head Brewery](http://www.dogfish.com/) for their Ancient Ales series. And through some local collaboration with local brewery [Storm Brewing in Newfoundland](http://www.stormbrewing.ca/), [Brew Craft](http://brewcraft.com/) Homebrew Shop, [Sap World](http://www.sapworld.ca/), and gypsy brewers Chad Levesque and Stephen Canning, visitors will be able to enjoy two beers based on ancient recipes:  _Levesque Midas Touch Collaborative Clone_ and _Canning Kvasir Collaborative Clone_. After the presentation and Q&A session, there will be a supper of lamb shank and flank steak paired by Chef Ian Smith. The tasting will continue with several selections from [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/), led by Brewmaster Daniel Girard, and from Storm Brewing in Newfoundland, led by owner and brewer Mike McBride, for a full evening of beer, food and fun. Tickets for the event are $90, and are available by emailing [Tom Beckett](mailto:tom.beckett<at>nl.rogers.com) before April 29th.

Enjoy the weekend, and the (hopefully) warmer temps! While you are out and about this weekend, stop into the ANBL and fill up your growler with [Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) _Lancaster KB882_ [Amber Lager](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/03/27/friday-wrap-up-20150327/), Picaroons _Historical Brown Ale_ (formerly known as _104th Regiment Ale_), and/or (we vote **and**) [Le Trou du Diable's](http://troududiable.com/bieres/dubai-pillee/) _Dubai Pillee Imperial IPA_. For the first time, all four fill ANBL filling stations will have the same three beers available. And for those of you in Fredericton, be sure to drop by [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) to buy a pint and growler of _Monk's Choice_, the name chosen from the submissions for their Abbey Ale. In Nova Scotia, Muwin Wines has received a loan from ACOA to expand distribution of [Bulwark Cider](http://www.bulwarkcider.com/) to the UK, a massive Cider market. The extra funds will go towards additional equipment to expand production, and re-branding their bottled packaged product. Tickets for the [Full House Beer Fest](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/499/full-house-craft-beer-fest), the highlight of the [CBANS Nova Scotia Craft Beer Week](http://nscraftbeer.ca/), are now officially sold out, though there is a waiting list available. Tickets for [Beer & Beethoven](https://symphonynovascotia.ca/concerts-and-tickets/concerts/2014-2015/beer-beethoven/) (May 8th at the Halifax Forum), [Science of Beer](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/512/the-science-of-beer) (May 14th at the Discovery Centre) and [Brewer's Brunch](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/516/brewers-brunch) (May 17th at Stubborn Goat) are still available, however. We'll be sharing details on more of the events in the coming weeks. [Spindrift Brewing](https://twitter.com/spindrift_brew) in Dartmouth has taken delivery of their brewhouse recently, and are busy setting it up and preparing for their first brew day in the coming weeks. And finally, in new more brewery news, [Trestle Brewing](http://www.trestlebrewing.com/) is set to open in Truro in the fall. The brainchild of Alicia MacDonald and Sonja Mills, it will be located in the downtown area. We'll share more details when available. And for those of you lucky enough to have tickets to tomorrow's sold-out [Saint John Beer Fest](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest), enjoy the selection of craft beer! With even more breweries and beer than last year, it's bound to be a great time as usual!
