We've had a busy week in Atlantic Canada, here's the quick summary. Check the attached links for more details:



	
  * [Propeller Brewing Co](http://drinkpropeller.ca/) in Halifax will be expanding to a second location. Having visited their Gottingen Street location many times, I can say that they outgrew it years ago, so I'm very happy to hear that there are solid plans in the works.

	
  * [Garrison Brewing Co](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) in Halifax has released their Comet IPA, the first in a series of Single Hop beers. It is available at the brewery, private beer stores, and select NSLC locations (sorry NB, PEI and NL readers!).

	
  * Good news from the [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](https://frederictoncraftbeerfestival.eventbrite.ca/) (March 9 at the Delta Fredericton): they are beginning to release their list of breweries who will be attending. So far  [Gahan House/PEI Brewing Co](http://www.peibrewingcompany.com/), [Garrison Brewing Co](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com), [McClelland Imports](http://www.mcclellandbeers.ca/test/products/products_index.shtml) (reps for Affligem, Delerium Tremens and others) have been announced, but there will be plenty more!

	
  * Bad news from the[ Garrison District Ale House](http://www.thegarrison.ca/): the damage was more extensive than first thought, and the road to recovery will take several months.

	
  * The first of many fundraisers for the[ GDAH staff](https://www.facebook.com/FundraiserForGarrisonStaff) was held last night at [Marky's Laundromat Expresso Bar](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/) in Moncton. Check our [Calendar page](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/calendar-of-events/) to keep to up date with the next ones planned in Fredericton and afar.

	
  * Speaking of the Calendar: if you have any events you would like to have featured, please let us know (either in the comments or via the [Contact](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/contact/) page).

	
  * This past Tuesday was the monthly [Brewnosers meeting](http://www.brewnosers.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=3658). There was a solid turnout of 15 members, and we tasted ~25 homebrewed and commercial beers. If you live in the HRM, consider coming out for them to share some great food and drink, on the [second Tuesday of the month](http://www.brewnosers.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=5&sid=4047d11ce33de14b1fc9cd37a5dddf17).

	
  * The [Aleanders](http://www.brewnosers.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=34) (PEI's homebrew and beer appreciation club) also met on Tuesday, with about 10 people in attendance.
