Good morning, and welcome to another weekend! As per usual, there's plenty going on in beer news this week, including yet even more breweries opening up soon in our region. For news on Fredericton's newest brewery, [Bogtrotter Craft Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/BogtrotterCraftBrewery/), check out [yesterday's post](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/08/25/bogtrotter-craft-brewery-opening-in-fredericton-in-september-2016/). We have also posted a profile on Saint John, NB's new [Loyalist City Brewing](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/08/26/loyalist-city/), late Friday.

• Although the Cherry and Blackberry variation of the _Barrel-aged Belgian Golden Strong_ isn’t quite ready, there’s plenty of action this week from [TataBrew](http://tatabrew.com/); Thursday saw two releases, a new brew of a favourite from the **Giant Beer Series** and a brand new seasonal offering. First, the [CBA Gold Medal-winning](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/winners/2016-winner-list/) _Russian Imperial Stout_ has been brewed again with a similar recipe, but slightly subdued on the hop side and with more richness and mouthfeel. Although it’s ready to drink now, at 8.5% ABV it’s sure to develop in the bottle, so when you head down to the brewery maybe grab a couple and set one aside for a winter night in 2017 or beyond. Second, and coinciding with the [Wild Blueberry Harvest Festival](http://wildblueberryfest.com/) underway in the northwestern part of the province, _Blue Bales_ is a blueberry wheat beer featuring 300 pounds of local organic berries from [North of Nuttby Farm](http://www.tatamagouchefarmersmarket.ca/vendors/north-of-nuttby-farm.html) on which it aged for 5 days. At only 8 IBUs from a single **Bramling Cross** addition and 4.8% ABV, the blueberries are bound to take center stage.

• As if that wasn’t enough new beer, Friday night will see the release of a brand new IPA, _Strikhedonia_. A little heavier than the _Deception Bay_ IPA at 6.7% ABV and 70 IBU, this one is bittered with **Chinook** and features aroma and flavours from late additions of **Citra**, **Huell Melon** and **Mosaic**, that bring a dank and juicy fruitiness along with classic IPA flavors. Both the _Blue Bales_ and the _Strikhedonia_ will be available in growlers from the brewery this weekend and with draft and cans starting next week. There are also pins of each that will be tapped at the brewery over the next two weekends, so keep an eye on social media for announcements from TataBrew and your favourite taproom to see where and when they can be found.

• [Meander River](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) has a new beer pouring at their brewery in Ashdale, NS - _Creamsicle of Wheat_ is a sessionable (3.9% ABV) Wheat Ale that the brewery is describing as a "light summer beer with a hint of citrus", thanks to the addition of peeled oranges during the fermentation process. Available for growler fills at the brewery, you can also find it on tap at a few licensees and their table at Saturday's [Halifax Forum Farmers' Market](http://forumfarmersmarket.ca/). In other Meander River news, they will be extracting their raised-on-site honey over the next few weeks for their annual batch of _Ashdale Honey Brown_, a 5.2% ABV Brown Ale brewed with toasted malts. They also plan on harvesting their locally-grown hops this weekend and again in early September; check out their social media accounts for updates, and feel free to contact them for more details on how you can be involved. And finally, they will be once again participating in [Open Farm Day](http://www.meetyourfarmer.ca/openfarmday/) on Sunday, **September 18th**; if you're in the area, be sure to drop by for tours and tastings.




• Digby's [Roof Hound Brewery](http://roofhound.ca/) is releasing their newest beer tomorrow, _Wasted Days_ Chocolate Peanut Butter Wheat. This mouthful of a name is a mouthful of a beer! Building on a 5.1% ABV North American Wheat base, the addition of cocoa, peanut butter, and lactose come together for a wonderful meeting of the minds. Light hopping to 16 IBUs allows the specialty ingredients to take centre-stage. To launch the beer, Roof Hound is inviting several musical guests to the tap room, including Jeremy Outhouse of [Tide and Timbre](https://www.facebook.com/tideandtimbre/) and Curt Leblanc of [Rain Over St. Ambrose](https://www.facebook.com/RainOverStAmbrose), whose [Wasted Days](https://rainoverstambrose.bandcamp.com/track/wasted-days) song inspired the name of the brew. _Wasted Days_ joins _Little Pup_ Pale Ale and _Rooftop Rye-It_ on the taps, with several new beers in the pipeline to be released in the coming weeks.






• Saint John's [First City](https://www.facebook.com/FirstCityBrewing/) has released a new beer, _Wheat IPA_. Approximately half of the grist is made up of Wheat malt, giving the beer a "crisp and light body", according to the brewery. Hopped primarily with **Chinook** and **Summit** to 70 IBUs, it features "strong aromas of pineapple and citrus", and weighs in at 7% ABV. You can find it on tap now at select First City accounts around the city, and at the James Joyce in Fredericton.


• [Port Rexton Brewing](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) released a small batch of a brand new beer this week. _Nar Bitter_ Bitter is a 5.7% ABV ESB (Extra Special Bitter), featuring a malt-forward flavour with caramel undertones thanks to the traditional English malts used. As this was a smaller-than-usual batch, you'll have to enjoy it on tap at the brewery, where you can also grab a pint of their _Horsechops_ IPA, _T-Rex_ Porter (formerly known as _Night 'Bous_), and _Baycation_ Blonde. They are open 2:00-10:00pm daily on [Ship Cove Road](https://goo.gl/maps/BCd3oBUCoMk). **Late Addition: **Well, that didn't last long! The _NBB_ has finished, so the PR crew have tapped _Mr. Wheaty Pants_ at the brewery. A 4.4% ABV wheat beer with body, and a touch of **Centennial** bitterness to complete the package. Grab _it_ today.

• [Mill Street Brewpub](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) in St John's has a new beer on tap these days. _Come From Away_ IPA is an English-style IPA, with 5.6% ABV. With a hearty 60 IBUs bitterness and floral & fruity hop aromatics, the clean fermented features a balanced body with amber colour and caramel notes. Available by the pint, or in growlers to go now. And a trial batch of a special beer flew like hotcakes earlier this week: _Rhuby Cove_ was a tart beer, aged for 2 months on strawberries, raspberries, and rhubarb grown in Portugal Cove - St. Philip's. Due to its big success, look for this beer to be released in a bigger batch in the future!

• [Mama's Brew Pub](http://www.mamaspubwesthills.com/) has been receiving positive customer feedback on two of their latest brews. First up is their _Old World Pale Ale_, which brewmaster Ryan Kingston brewed in the style of a traditional British Pale Ale. Featuring a grist of Maris Otter and Crystal 70 L, the beer was hopped with **Goldings** sourced from [Southan Farms](http://www.southanfarms.net/), as well as the American variety, **Amarillo**, for an interesting twist to the style; 5.1% ABV, 16 IBUs. Their _Blueberry Wheat_ was also released recently; Kingston brewed a wheat beer and fermented it with a Hefeweizen yeast strain, for plenty of banana, clove, and a "Juicy Fruit bubble-gum aspect". After fermentation, 50 lbs of blueberries were added to secondary, giving the beer a purple hue and hints of blueberry flavour. Weighing in at 5% ABV, and available now with the _Old World_, at the brew pub for pints.

• [Grimross Brewing](http://grimross.com/) is releasing a new beer - _Grimdonk_ - later this afternoon at the brewery. Designated as a Belgian Blond Ale, it was fermented with a new-to-Grimross yeast strain that originates from the Breendonk region of Belgium (hence the beer's name). It comes in at 7% ABV; expect plenty of fruity esters and spicy phenols, as well as a dry finish, characteristic of this style. Swing by for a pint or growler fill today, and look for it to be hitting taps in the Fredericton area soon.

Lots of new events coming up, and as always, keep an eye on our [Calendar of Events](http://acbeerblog.ca/calendar-of-events/) page to see what's on the horizon.

• [Savoie's Brewhouse](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Savoies-Brewhouse/1617785005132093?fref=ts) and the [Heron's Nest Pub](https://www.facebook.com/HeronsNestPub/?fref=ts) are holding a Customer Appreciation Day **tomorrow, August 27th**, at the Heron's Nest in Charlo.

Good luck, homebrewers!

Believe it or not, there's even more beer news we want to be sure you read before heading out for a pint:

- Big Spruce's hoppy collaboration with [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/), _Gimme Citra_, is back for a limited time. Hopped entirely with **Citra**, it's tropical, fruity, and extremely quaffable at 4.7% ABV.
- [Bore City](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/) has brewed their last batch of _Equilux_ - an American Pale Ale featuring** Citra** and **Equinox** hops - for the year; two kegs have made their way to the James Joyce in Fredericton. If you haven't tried this one yet, we encourage you to seek it out! It won't be around again until sometime next year.
- Keep an eye out for [Hammond River](http://hrbrewing.ca/)'s _Too Hop to Handle_ Double IPA at better Saint John bars now. This 8.4% ABV and 150+ IBUs beer is only brewed a few times a year, and is always a quick seller.
- [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/)'s collaboration with [Gahan House - Halifax](http://halifax.gahan.ca/), _Over the Top!_, has returned. A 4% ABV "sour mash cranberry wheat ale", it features an addition of Nova Scotia cranberries to complement the already tart and dry finish. Look for it in growlers and on tap around the province now.
- [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com)'s _Eighty Bob_, their 4.5% ABV Scottish Export Ale, is now in regular rotation, and is also available in bottles for the first time, at the brewery and PEILCC stores, as well as at Bishop's Cellar in Halifax.
- [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) just tapped a new batch of their IPA, _Hugh John Hops_, and it's tasting super-fresh! Drop by the brewery for a pint and/or growler fill.
- After a brief hiatus, [Unfiltered](http://hoppyasballs.ca)'s _Riddle of Steel_ is back today. This 7.0% ABV IPA is full of hops, weighing in at approximately 80 IBUs, brewed with the famous [Conan/Vermont Ale](http://www.theyeastbay.com/brewers-yeast-products/vermont-ale) yeast. Growler fills and pints from noon!
