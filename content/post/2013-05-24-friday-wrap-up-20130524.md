It's been a hectic week at the ACBB "offices", here's the important news you need to know about beer in our area:

• Tonight, [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) continues their Plaid to the Bone launch in Perth-Andover. Featuring their Heather Ale, the "Picaroons Castle Ceilidh" will be held at the [Castle Inn](http://www.castleinn.ca/). The festivities begin at 7 pm, and will include the [Southern Victoria Pipe Band](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Southern-Victoria-Pipe-Band/222118211182387) and [Fredericton’s Highland Dancers](https://www.facebook.com/frederictonhighland.danceaccociation), followed by PEI's [Ten Strings and a Goat Skin](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ten-Strings-and-a-Goat-Skin/134065649937386) (who continue to tour New Brunswick for this beer's launch). There will be a large "Picaroons-infused" pub menu, with food items ranging from Best Bitter-battered onion rings to grilled salmon with Simeon Jones garlic cream. The launch continues Saturday night in Moncton at [Plan B](http://planbmoncton.com/) (after the beer festival), where Ten Strings will be performing at 10 pm.

• [Mirella Amato](http://beerology.ca/) is in New Brunswick this week, taking part in events surrounding the [Atlantic Beer Festival](http://www.atlanticbeerfestival.ca/Atlantic_Beer_Festival_New/Home.html). She is hosting two events at [The Station](http://www.nbliquor.com/station.html) in Fredericton today: from 1-3pm, she will be running a mock beer competition, where participants will be able to taste some winning beers from the recent [Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/), learn how to judge beers, and even do some judging themselves. This event is free and open to the public. Later in the evening (6:30-8:30), Mirella will be leading a five-course tasting, highlighting the style range of beers, and how they can pair with food in some exciting and fascinating ways. Tickets are $25. As mentioned in [our previous post](http://wp.me/p23UN6-La), she will also be leading a VIP tour of the Atlantic Beer Festival, including appetizers at Pump House, limo ride to the fest, and a guided tasting of a handful of the best beers on tap at the fest.

• Last Saturday's [grand opening](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/friday-wrap-up-20130517/) of the new location for the [PEI Brewing Company](http://www.peibrewingcompany.com/) was a great success, with approximately 600 people attending the day's events, despite less-than-desirable weather. Two new beers were introduced, a Blueberry Ale, and a Mango Wheat. While both beers will continue to be available on tap at the PEI Brewing Company (the Mango Wheat for a limited time only), the Blueberry Ale will also be pouring at some bars/restaurants on the Island, and can also be found in bottles at the brewery and at [PEILCC](http://www.peilcc.ca/) locations.

• Halifax's [The Coast](http://www.thecoast.ca/) website has published its annual readers' poll results, and [Garrison Brewing Company](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has been selected as Best Craft Brewery! Runners-up were silver and bronze medal-winners, [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) and [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/), respectively. As for Best Brew Pub, [Rockbottom](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) unseated previous 9-time winner [Rogues Roost](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) to win the top prize. Rogues Roost finished second, followed by [Hart and Thistle](http://www.hartandthistle.com/). Congratulations to the winners!

• Speaking of Rockbottom, their Insidious IBA (India Black Ale) is [now on tap](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2013/05/insidious-iba-on-tap.html). This beer won a bronze medal in the American Style Black Ale (also known as Black IPA, Cascadian Dark Ale, etc) category at the recent Canadian Brewing Awards. Get it while it's ... cold!

• For those of you looking forward to getting a taste of one of the new Grimross beers tonight in Fredericton, there's some bad news... the Love Your Balls event has been cancelled. We originally reported on this charity event [last Friday](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/friday-wrap-up-20130517/). Looks like we'll all have to wait another few weeks until Grimross is available commercially.
