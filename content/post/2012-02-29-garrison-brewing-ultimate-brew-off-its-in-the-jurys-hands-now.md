[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/brew-off-poster-20121.png)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/brew-off-poster-20121.png)The deadline for submission for this year's Garrison Brewing Ultimate Brew-Off has come and gone and as per [their Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Garrison-Brewing-Co/184186131152)  a very impressive 62 RYE IPA entries were received.

Due to the volume, they'll be going through 5 / day in order to test them all (sounds really rough, let me know if I can help!).  As per the [contest entry form](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/pdfs/2012%20Garrison%20Brew-Off.pdf), all entries will be reviewed and receive an evaluation for Garrison Master Brewer Daniel Girard.  The top 4 entries will then by judged by a group of BJCP certified judges.

Awards will be presented on Thursday, March 22nd with finalists asked to bring samples of their brew for attendees to sample.
