[![photo 4](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-4.jpg?w=300)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-4.jpg)

The second annual [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) (FCBF) will be taking place on March 8th at the[ Fredericton Convention Centre](http://www.frederictonconventions.ca/) downtown. With about 1000 tickets being sold, the event will see almost twice as many beer lovers as last year's festival. I was able to sit down with Lloyd Chambers, organizer of the FCBF, to discuss what will be offered at this year's event.

**What brought on the change in venue this year [last year's**** festival was held at the Delta Fredericton]?**

With about 550 people attending last year's festival, the Delta Fredericton's space worked out perfect. This year, however, we'll see almost twice that many, so we needed to move to something bigger. The Convention Centre was able to provide us with that space, and also has the advantage of being right downtown, close to other beer-friendly spots such as the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/).

**Do you have any sponsors for this year's festival?**

Yes; major sponsors include the King Street Ale House, [Massive Graphics](http://www.massivegraphics.ca/), and [The Pub Magazine](http://www.thepubmagazine.com/) (Atlantic Canada edition).

**Tell me about the different ticket offerings you've been selling.**

There's about 700 "regular" admission tickets that JUST sold out yesterday. These $50 tickets include a custom tasting glass, and unlimited 2 oz samples of the beers at the festival from 7:30-10:00 pm.

We also sold 250 "VIP" tickets this year; for $60, you get entry into the festival an hour earlier. They were extremely popular when they went on sale in late November; they sold out in about 4 hours!

In recognition of March 8th also being International Women's Day, we decided to partner with the [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) in Halifax and offer "Women's-only VIP" tickets. These 50 tickets (also sold out) were a great deal, giving ticket-holders 90-minute early entry into the festival, with a larger, custom tasting glass, "Beer 101" with [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) Brewer Kellye Robertson and Pam Crouse (Co-Executive director of the LBL), samples from local "beerlebrities" Stephen Dixon of [Grimross Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) and Adam Clawson of [Red Rover Brewing](http://www.redroverbrew.com/), and an extra beer sample from Quebec brewery [Unibroue](http://www.unibroue.com/). Investors Group will make a donation on behalf of the FCBF to a local women's charity.

**Any options for Designated Drivers?**

Yes, there are $15 tickets available, which include unlimited bottled water and soda (and the snacks below), including a Root Beer made by Garrison Brewing Co.

**Are there any food options available during the festival?**

There will be a few different food samples available, such as popcorn from [Magzy's Kettle Korn](https://www.facebook.com/MagzysKettleKorn), and salmon from [Miramichi Smoked Salmon](http://miramichismokedsalmon.com/about-us/); there may be one or two other options as well. I should also note that on Saturday, before the festival begins, [The Lunar Rogue](http://www.lunarrogue.com/) will be offering 15% off food when you show your FCBF ticket.

**Are any hotels in the city offering discounted rates for the festival?**

Yes, the [Crowne Plaza Fredericton/Lord Beaverbrook](http://www.ihg.com/crowneplaza/hotels/us/en/fredericton/yfcqs/hoteldetail) is currently offering a festival rate of $109/night for both Friday and Saturday, March 7th and 8th._ [note: the link for the discounted rate is [here](https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&eventID=10870992&utm_source=55344&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=26787945)]_

**It looks like you're expecting more breweries and beer for this year's festival, compared to last year?**

Absolutely. Last year we had 18 breweries and 91 beers; this year, we have a combination of 28 brewers and distributors, with about 150 different beers being poured. Specifically, we've got a larger showing from the Maritimes this year, including newer breweries such as Grimross Brewing, Red Rover Brewing, and Sunset Heights Meadery from New Brunswick; Bad Apple Brewhouse, Big Spruce, Boxing Rock, Bridge Brewing, and Uncle Leo's from Nova Scotia, and Barnone Brewing from PEI. We've got a couple of non-Maritime breweries coming - Saskatchewan's Bushwakker will be returning this year (including owner Bev Robertson), and Le Naufrageur from Quebec will be making their first appearance.

**Will there be many brewers and/or representatives from each brewery to provide information about their beers, answer questions, etc.?**

Luckily, just about every brewery (except one or two) will have brewers or brewery reps coming to the festival, pouring their beers and providing info. We'll also have about 35-40 volunteers helping out.

**Before we get to the most important information - the brewers/beer list - anything else you'd like to add?**

Just that we're really happy to be able to build on the success of last year's festival by opening the event to even more people, and bringing even more beers than before. As our tagline says, "It's all about the beer. Pure. Simple."
