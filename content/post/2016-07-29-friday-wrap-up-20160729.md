Good morning! After a brief hiatus last week, due to vacation on one's part and work travelling on the other's, we're back and ready to continue the work of spreading the love of beer! Good thing nothing happened during that.... oh, crap.

• [Port Rexton Brewing](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) opened last weekend in ... [Port Rexton, Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Rexton). Located a few hours Northwest of St John's on the Bonavista Peninsula, PRB is the first brewery to open outside of the Avalon Peninsula. After a busy opening weekend, they are now in a groove, open daily 2-10pm for samples, pints, and growler fills. They are now pouring a pair of beers, with more on the way very shortly: _Horse Chops_ IPA is a 6% ABV/72 IBUs American-style IPA, featuring lots of West Coast hops (including a dry hop with **Mosaic**) on a medium body; their _Night 'Bous_ Porter is 6.5% ABV and 29 IBUs, with lots of chocolate flavours in the "medium-sweet body". We'll be sharing more details on the brewery and the great duo behind the beer soon, but in the meantime, take a trip to P.R. for a solid pint this weekend!

• There's another new brewery opening soon in New Brunswick, and while details are currently very slim, Fundy Bay Brewco currently has a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/fundybaybrew) started. Sounds like the brewery will be located in Sussex, with three beers listed as "coming soon": _Alma IPA_, a 6.5% ABV, 50 IBUs "West-Coast style IPA" with aromas of pine, citrus, and tropical fruit; _Digby Dubbel_, a 7.2% ABV Belgian Dubbel fermented with a Belgian yeast strain to give aromas of "dark fruits, sassafras, caramel, leather, and toasted grain"; and _St. Martin's ISA_, a 4.8% ABV, 25 IBUs Session IPA hopped with **Mosaic** and **Falconer's Flight**. We'll have more details on the brewery soon; in the meantime, be sure to follow them on Twitter to stay up-to-date with their progress.

• After a year-long hiatus, [Shiretown](https://www.facebook.com/shiretown/?fref=ts) will be making their return at tomorrow's [Bon Ami Flavor Fest](http://www.bonamifestival.com/index.html), held at the Dalhousie Lion's Club from 7 pm - 2 am. They will be pouring two beers: their flagship, _Blonde du Quai_, a 4.5% ABV Blonde Ale, and _Cartier's Columbus_, a new beer the brewery describes as a "Golden IPA", weighing in at 6.2% ABV, and hopped entirely with** Columbus** to 60 IBUs. Shiretown is aiming for bottles of both beers to hit select ANBL stores around mid-August; we'll keep you updated!

• There's a new beer available from [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/), a SMaSH (single-malt and single-hop) Pale Ale named _La Glazier_. Brewed entirely with Pale malt from [Malt-Broue](http://www.maltbroue.com/en/), a nearby Quebec "micromaltery", and hopped with **Cascade** from [Aroostook Hops](http://www.aroostookhops.com/) in Northern Maine, it comes in at 4.9% ABV and 30 IBUs. Featuring "citrus notes and a slight bitterness", it's available on tap at the brewery, and select ANBL growler stations this weekend, as well as select bars/restaurants in the province. And congratulations to Petit-Sault on their recent expansion, thanks to further buying-in by ACOA, the New Brunswick government, and their community investors. [More details here](http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2016.07.0696.html).

• [Distillerie Fils du Roy](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/) has released another new beer, _Hommage à 1755_, a Belgian Strong Ale. A style very similar to the more-commonly-seen Belgian Tripel, it's a pale-coloured, bitter, effervescent beer that finishes extremely dry (thanks to high attenuation by the Belgian yeast strain), with a "spicy/fruity, resinous hop profile, and a soft, supportive grainy-sweet malt palate", according to the brewery. Weighing in at 7% ABV and 22 IBUs, it's available in bottles now, as well as on tap at all of the [ANBL Growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) filling stations this weekend. As the name implies, it is an homage to [1755](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1755_(band)), a band that popularized Acadian music in the 70's/'80's, and still active today.

• [Hell Bay](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) has released their first Black IPA, _Black Flag IPA_. As dark as the name suggests, this 6.1% ABV beer has notes of "roasted malt and rum flavours upfront, followed by earthy and citrus notes". Hopped with **Chinook** and **Ahtanum** (to 55 IBUs), it's available on tap at the brewery for growler fills, and should pop up on tap at the [Port Grocer](http://www.theportgrocer.ca/), [Rhubarb](http://www.rhubarbrestaurant.ca/), and [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/).

• [Wayfarers' Ale Society](http://wayfarersale.ca/) has released the third of their offerings recently at their Port Williams brewery. _Thistle Dew_ is a 4.8% ABV Scottish Ale, described as "a malty ale with a low hop profile". The rich copper colour leads to a medium body and very light bitterness (20 IBUs). Now on tap at the brewery for samples, pints, and growlers, it joins their _Hellene_ Blonde Ale and _Ruby Ale_ Irish Red Ale. Look for a pair of new beers from them in the coming weeks, their _EPA_ English Pale Ale and _One-Eyed River Hog_ IPA.

•[ Mill Street St John's](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) has released their latest brew, _Caribou Cream Ale_. Weighing in at 5% ABV and 20 IBUs, this easy-drinking beer is available on tap at Mill Street/[Bier Markt](http://www.thebiermarkt.com/st-johns/) and to go in growlers as well. This easy-drinking, thirst-quenching beer was fermented with two yeast strains (first with a British ale strain, then with a German lager strain) "to impart complexity and smoothness", and exhibits "fresh, cracker malt with a slight hop aroma and yeast undertones", according to the brewery. Also note that $1 from every growler sale will be donated to the newly-opened [Royal Newfoundland Regiment Museum](http://www.rnfldr.ca/museum.aspx).

• Last week, [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) released a new beer available on tap only at their brewpub in Moncton. _Raspberry Wheat_ is a German-style Wheat beer that has been "bombarded" with 70 kg of fresh raspberries, and is described by the brewery as "tart and refreshing", with plenty of raspberry in the aroma and flavour. Clocking in at 6.2% ABV, get down to the brewpub for a pint before it's gone!

• Mahone Bay's [Saltbox Brewery](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) is launching this weekend, to coincide with the [Mahone Bay Heritage Boat Yard Festival](http://www.heritageco-op.ca/). Visit their tent on the Town Wharf **Saturday** and **Sunday**, 1-5pm both days, to grab a taste of their beer or some merchandise. And then visit their brewery (open the same hours) on Main Street to grab growler fills of the beers. They will have their _Hefeweizen_, _India Pale Ale_, and _Dark Cream Ale_ available, with a new _Light Pilsner_ possibly making an appearance, if ready. Depending on beer availability, their retail storefront will be open going forward, as they are currently releasing beers brewed on their pilot system, while they await the arrival of their full-sized brewhouse. Keep an eye on their [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/saltboxbrewery) for exact details.

• [Bulwark](http://www.bulwarkcider.com/) will be releasing a [New Ross](http://newross.ca/) 200th Anniversary edition of their _Oak Aged Cider_. Long in the making, the cider spent more than six months maturing in American oak barrels, and is packaged in a bottle designed by local resident Bonnie Keddy. The barrel is an ode to the many cooperages that were in the New Ross area, thanks to the locally-designed apple barrels needed to support the apple industry. The 7.0% ABV cider is now ready for purchase at their homebase, [Muwin Estate Wines](http://www.muwinestate.com/) (either by phone or email), and will be on sale at the [New Ross 200th Anniversary Night Market](http://newross.ca/event/200th-anniversary-celebration/) on Friday, August 5. As a way of giving back to the community and thanking them for all of their support, a portion of the sales will be donated to the New Ross Development Society.

• [Nine Locks](http://www.ninelocksbrewing.ca) has released their first seasonal, _Watermelon Blonde_, perfect for the remaining days of summer. Described by the brewery as "light and crisp, with a hint of watermelon", with whole fresh watermelon added during the mash, as well as in a post-fermentation secondary (as well as some natural extract). This 5.0% ABV, 12 IBU beer is available now for growler fills and cans at the brewery. And congratulations to them on their recent expansion in the brewhouse - with the addition of three 72hl (60 BBL) fermentors, they will be better able to keep up with demand and different seasonal options.

• There's a new beer on tap at [Big Spruce's](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) tasting room, thanks to a collaboration with Shelburne's [Boxing Rock Brewery](http://www.boxingrock.ca/). _Stark Craving Mad_ is an "Amber American IPA" with lots of late-addition hops for a serious hop flavour and nose. The beer weighs in at 7.2% ABV and 65 IBUs, and is currently only available at the Big Spruce tap room, so drop by today! And when you do, grab some grub from the [Cruisin' Cuisine Food Truck](https://www.facebook.com/ccft2015/), onsite 12-7 pm Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with live music 3-5 pm daily. Check out the FB [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/880787052026282/) for details on the menu and music schedule.

• And speaking of Boxing Rock, after three years in operation, they just packaged their 1,000,000th bottle this week! To celebrate, they've hidden winning tickets in six of their _Hunky Dory _Pale Ale six-packs, which can be returned to the brewery for some sweet swag. Congratulations! They also did a small tasting of a [Gin-infused Pale Ale](https://twitter.com/boxingrockbeer/status/758745717288505344) at [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) last night, which looks be prelude to a wider release soon.

• After a very successful launch at the [Alderney Landing Farmers' Market](http://www.alderneylanding.com/market/) earlier this month, [Brightwood Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/Brightwood-Brewery-1610933532569337/) has released their second beer. _Smokey the Beer_ is a Honey Smoke Ale featuring, unsurprisingly, Honey and Smoked malts in the grist, for an aromatic journey of the senses. First smoke, then honey sweetness, with some piney hop notes to complete the campfire feel. Grab this 5.3% ABV beer, and their _The Big Lift_ American IPA, at the Market this Saturday 8am-1pm. You can grab/exchange one of their own growlers, and they will fill personal growlers, provided they are nice and clean.

• There's a new beer soon to be tapped at the [Antigonish Townhouse](http://antigonishtownhouse.wordpress.com/) - brewmaster Terry Piercy brewed up an experimental batch in the style of an English Pale Ale, using [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) Organic Pale Malt. The light-coloured ale was hopped with UK **Fuggles** for both bittering and flavour additions, to 43 IBUs. Coming in at a sessionable 4.7% ABV, look for this currently-unnamed brew to be released in a couple of weeks, where it will likely be cask-conditioned and served on the pub's hand-pump.


There are a whole slew of events coming up in the next little while, so be sure to keep your calendar open for the following opportunities to drink great beer:


• [Unfiltered Brewing](http://hoppyasballs.ca) turns one-year-old **today**, and they're throwing a celebration at their Charm School Pub, with $5 pints all day (that's noon till late), and a "special Nash-inspired menu" from 5-10 pm, served by [Food Wolf](http://www.thefoodwolf.com/). Happy 1st Anniversary!

• In other 1st Anniversary news, [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) is celebrating theirs on **Saturday, July 30th** with a slightly-belated [Birthday Breakfast](https://www.facebook.com/events/1328790107150734/?active_tab=highlights) at the brewery from 9 am - 12 pm. The first 100 breakfasts (prepared by local [STAND & STUFF Your Face](https://www.facebook.com/standandstuffyourface/)) are free, and live music will be playing.

We'll have more details on the event early next week, including info on a mega-collaboration brewday happening at [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) with many of the visiting breweries.

• [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/) will be hosting a Tap Takeover by [Stillwater Artisanal Brewery](http://www.stillwater-artisanal.com/works.html) **Saturday August 6th**. With a homebase in Maryland, Stillwater is a gypsy brewery, not owning their own equipment, but rather releasing beers brewed at others' locations. There will be 10 different Stillwater beers available on tap starting at noon Saturday, and it will be a pay-as-you-go event, no tickets needed. We have the inside scoop on a few of the beers that will be flowing, including _Mono_, a 5.2% ABV Hoppy Pilsner; _As Follows_, a 9.0% ABV Belgian Strong Golden; and _Vacuum_, an 8.0% Black Smoked IPA. For those who can't wait until Saturday for a taste, _Stillwater Classique_, a 4.5% ABV farmhouse beer, is currently available in cans at Stillwell's homebase on Barrington.

• The [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/) is hosting a special [sneak preview party](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/lbl-preview-party-with-2-crows-brewing-tickets-26752414191) with [2 Crows Brewing](http://2crowsbrewing.com/), a new 20 BBL (23 hL) Halifax brewery set to open this fall, on **Thursday, August 18th**. Held at the home of two of the owners from 7-10 pm, all three of their core brands will be available to be sampled, as well as a few surprises. Tickets (available through the link above) are only $10, with all proceeds going to [Feed Nova Scotia](http://www.feednovascotia.ca/) (and they will be accepting further donations for FNS during the event)

Have a fantastic long weekend, hopefully surrounded by plenty of great beer! For those of you in New Brunswick, note that this weekend, all five [ANBL growler stations](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) will be pouring beers that were brewed by NB breweries (FYI, ANBL stores will be **closed** Monday August 1st). And in closing...

- A reminder that there's still a few tickets remaining for the [Fredericton Beer Tour](https://www.facebook.com/events/262486610784204/) (Saturday, August 6th) that we mentioned [two weeks ago](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/07/15/friday-wrap-up-20160715/); your $77 ticket (available [here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/fredericton-beer-tour-tickets-26580997479?ref=enivtefor001&invite=MTA0NTIwNTUvZnJlZGVyaWN0b25iZWVyQGdtYWlsLmNvbS8w&utm_source=eb_email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=inviteformalv2&utm_term=attend)) will get you transportation to five breweries/cideries, chat time with the brewers, and a minimum of four 4-oz samples per stop.
- [Grimross](http://grimross.com/) has officially started canning, as their _Maritime Pale Ale_ is available now in 500 mL cans at the brewery; the beer will hopefully be available at select ANBL stores in the near future. Look for their Saison, _Cheval D'Or_, to be canned by early fall.
- [Maybee](https://www.facebook.com/maybeebrew/?fref=ts) has bottled their Long Carry Brett Red in a limited number of 750 mL cork-and-cage bottles; labels are currently being printed, so look for these to be available at the brewery within the next couple of weeks.
- Keep your eyes peeled for a new _English Mild_ from [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/). This 3.7% ABV beer has been spotted in the wild at Battery Park and Stillwell, and will surely satisfy the "sessionable" crowd, it's a flavourful beer in a small package. And on the other end of the spectrum, they are serving an _English Barley Wine_ at the brewery, but details on it are a little slim at the moment.

Phew, that's it! That'll teach us to never take a week off again!
