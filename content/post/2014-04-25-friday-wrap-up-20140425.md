Happy Friday everyone! Time for another dose of Atlantic Canadian beer news to finish off the last Friday of the month...

• [Bad Apple Brewhouse](https://www.facebook.com/badapplebrewhouse) has released a new beer, _Smokehouse Lager_, a [Rauchbier](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style22.php#1a) brewed with 100% beechwood-smoked malt. This copper-colored beer comes in at 6.7% ABV with about 27 IBUs, and is described as "smoky, slightly spicy, and malty" by BAB owner/brewer Jeff Saunders. The beer is available in growlers and squealers at the brewery, and might be on tap at your local soon.

• Staying in the Annapolis Valley, [Sea Level](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) has released their latest beer, _Southern Cross IPA_. Inspired by the [New Zealand hop](http://www.nzhops.co.nz/varieties/southern_cross.html), and the [Crosby, Stills and Nash song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPK_IV-J3Co), the beer weighs in at 6.5% and 78.8 IBUs (calc). The Southern Cross hops lend a resiny spiciness and citrus and pine aromas. Available on tap now at [The Port Pub](http://www.theportpub.com/), in growlers and cans at the brewery, and this weekend in cans at the private beer stores in Halifax.

• Finally in Valley news this week, both [Meander River Farm and Brewery](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) and [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://schoolhousebrewery.ca/) are in the final stretches before opening their doors very soon. At Meander River, they have brewed their inaugural batch of _Lunchbox Pale Ale_ on their 3 barrel system, and are looking forward to opening in the next few weeks. At Schoolhouse, they were going through their inspection for Excise License this week, and are also looking forward to opening in the next little while. Look for profiles from both of these great breweries very soon.

• In the big city, [Propeller Brewing](http://drinkpropeller.ca/) has released their latest seasonal beer, _Black IPA_. Weighing in at 6.7%ABV and 83 IBUs, this unfiltered beer features a healthy amount of bittering, flavour and aroma hops, and is then dry-hopped for an even more explosive nose. The most prominent hop used in the beer is [Ahtanum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties#Ahtanum_brand_YCR_1_cv), which gives a great citrusy nose, with a bit of earthy note as well, which fits well with the style. To give the beer its distinctive black colour, [Blackprinz](http://www.brewingwithbriess.com/Products/Bitterless.htm) and [CARAFA](http://www.weyermann.de/can/gelbe_Seiten_cnd.asp?snr=1&idkat=1288&umenue=yes&idmenue=298&sprache=9) malts were used. These choices were very specific, as both are very dark in Lovibond, so that a small percentage in the recipe goes a long way in the colour, but do not transfer any astringency or husky bitterness to the flavour. Pick up 1.89l and 1l growlers of this latest release at both the [Gottingen St](https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=Propeller+Brewing+Company&fb=1&gl=ca&cid=1058032185307080965&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A) and [Windmill Rd](http://goo.gl/maps/YFZGT) Propeller locations, and look for it on tap around the city (including [Henry House](http://www.henryhouse.ca/), where it was tapped last night).

• [Big Tide Brewing](http://bigtidebrew.com/) continues to remain busy in Saint John, as they've added two new one-off brews to their tap selection at the brewpub. A single batch was brewed with a base of Canadian Wheat malt, a selection of special Crystal malts, and UK hops, and was then fermented with a dry ale yeast. After fermentation was complete, the beer was split into two vessels. One of these, _Ale Mary_, was filtered, while the other, _Sunset Raspberry Wheat_, was not. We think it's safe to assume that the unfiltered beer also has had some raspberries or raspberry extract added at some point of the brewing process! Both beers are meant to bridge the gap for Big Tide's return to brewing summer beers; they clock in at 4.5% ABV.

• New Brunswick's newest brewery, [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery), may have just opened last week, but they've already added a seasonal beer to their line-up, which is available for growler fills at the brewery now. The beer is named _Maple Wheat Amber Ale_; specific details on the beer are unknown at the moment, but we'll be sure to update when we know more.

• We [mentioned recently](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/04/11/friday-wrap-up-20140411/) that [Ducky's Bar](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar) in Sackville was expanding their tap selection, and would be featuring local breweries. Well, they've released their opening tap selection, and it's looking great! As previously mentioned, two taps will be dedicated to [Celtic Knot](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing), starting with their _Not Joe Average Pale Ale_ and _Dark Passage Oatmeal Stout_. Also pouring will be [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery)'s award-winning _Hop Flash IPA_, [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) _Cole's Cream Ale_ and _Beach Chair Lager_, and [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) _Raspberry Wheat_ and_ Nut Brown_, with [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) _Dooryard_ joining them soon. Kegs will rotate as they empty, so look for more offerings from these breweries, as well as others in our region!

• Tickets are now on sale for the [Atlantic Beer Festival](http://www.atlanticbeerfestival.ca/Atlantic_Beer_Festival_New/Home.html), in Moncton, Saturday May 31st. There are two sessions, 2:30-5pm, and 7:30-10pm. Free buses are available to the downtown area after each session of the festival. Tickets are [available online](https://tickets.moncton.ca), at the Pump House brewpub and Barnyard BBQ, and are priced at $49 (taxes and fees included). We hope to have a full brewery/beer list for you soon.

• **The Overcast** is an arts and culture newspaper based out of Newfoundland. They have an [excellent interview with Liam McKenna](http://issuu.com/theovercast/docs/april2014/18), brewmaster at [Yellowbelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St. John's. For those of you who do not know Liam's brewing history (including a time in Dublin), it is a great insight into what makes Liam tick. We hope to share a profile on Liam and the Yellowbelly soon, as we caught up with him on a visit to Newfoundland earlier in the year.

• Don't forget to pick up bottles of _Alewife's Revenge_, the collaboration between [Boxing Rock Brewing](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) and the [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague). It is now on sale at the private beer stores in Halifax and Dartmouth, on tap around the province (including [Antigonish Townhouse](http://antigonishtownhouse.blogspot.com/)), and a special cask of it starting at 4pm for Cask Friday at the [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/).

• Speaking of the Ladies Beer League, they're teaming up with [Noble Grape](http://noblegrape.ca/) to present an **Intro to Beer & Brewing** session on Sunday, May 25th from 1:00 pm - 4:00 pm. This is an introductory course meant to cover the basics of home brewing for beginners and enhance the knowledge of intermediate home brewers, while allowing those interested a chance to also connect with Halifax's home brewing community. Tickets are $20 and can be purchased [here](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/?event=intro-to-beer-brewing); the course will be held at the Noble Grape location on 95 Akerley Blvd in Darmouth. Another session is currently scheduled for Saturday, June 14th.

• [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/) is following up on their first [Bellwoods](http://bellwoodsbrewery.com/) beer releases earlier this month with another deadly trio this weekend. They will be pouring_ Brettal Head All Brett Pale Ale_, _Lost River Baltic Porter_, and _Hellwoods Russian Imperial Stout_, beginning at noon Sunday. Be sure to drop by for great beer, food, and company. We might just see you there!

That's it for now... have a great weekend!
