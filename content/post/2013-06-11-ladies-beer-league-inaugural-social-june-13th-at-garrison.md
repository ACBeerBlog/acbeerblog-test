Attention female beer fans (or not-yet fans, but interested in becoming one) in Halifax: there's a new group starting up, and you're all invited to join!

The brainchild of six female beer lovers who met at [Garrison Brewing Co](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/), the [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) is a group focusing on a friendly and fun environment for women to get together to taste, enjoy, share, and geek out on beer. Together with friends at beer businesses (breweries [Propeller Brewing Co](http://drinkpropeller.ca/) and [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/), and the four private beer stores), they will be hosting socials on the second Thursday of the month at a variety of venues across the HRM.

The first event is this Thursday, June 13th, 8-10pm, at Garrison. For a $5 entry fee, visitors will be able to sample beers, chat brewing with Garrison brewer Kellye Robertson, and tasting with BJCP judge [Tracy Phillippi](http://www.experiencecraftbeer.com/), and have a great time. This month, there will be a special cask-conditioned version of Garrison's Nit-Wit Belgian Witbier, fermented with Elderberry and Bilberry juice and NS honey. Come out to drink great beer, chat about beer, and decide the future of the League. Future events might include beer and food pairings, brewery tours, homebrew demonstrations, sharing of exciting beer from here and away; anything the members would like!

You can get the latest scoop from the LBL's [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ladybeerleague) pages.
