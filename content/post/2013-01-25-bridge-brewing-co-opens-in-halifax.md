After months of waiting and wading through red tape, Bridge Brewing is finally open!




Wednesday at 3pm marked the first day of business for the brewery at 2576 Agricola Street in Halifax, and it got off to a roaring start. A few die-hards waited in the -15C weather to be among the first to buy the beer (yours truly was among them). We even got to witness the wonderful sign being mounted.

After opening, the first dozen customers huddled inside, while owner Peter Burbridge and brewer Josh Herbin spoke about their two Belgian-inspired beers: Farmhouse Ale and Gus' 65m Blonde Ale. The Farmhouse has a solid malt sweetness balanced out with a refreshing tartness from the yeast and hop bitterness;  Big, Complex and refreshing. Candied Fruit Aroma (7.5% abv). The Gus' 65m Blonde has light fruit nose up front, citrus, background spice and a dry finish; a very refreshing session beer (6.5%).

The beer was so popular that they sold out of their pre-filled growlers within 3 hours! Since then, they've been busy filling growlers and selling them at break-neck speed. In fact, after today's 3-7pm opening, they will be closed until Wednesday (Jan 30) to refill the tanks, so go there right now! If you get thirsty on the weekend, Gus' 65m is curently on tap at Gus' Pub (2605 Agricola), only 65 metres North of Bridge (hence the name).




They also have glasses and t-shirts for the beer-swag-minded.

Cheers to a great opening, and continued success! We look forward to following Bridge as they continue to help expand the beer scene in the Atlantic Provinces.
