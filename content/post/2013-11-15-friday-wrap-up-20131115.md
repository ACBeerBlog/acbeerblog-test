Good morning, everyone! We're halfway through November already... here's some beer news for the week to distract you from the oncoming stress of the Christmas season...

• As mentioned in [yesterday's post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/king-street-ale-house-opens-in-fredericton/) concerning the opening of the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) in Fredericton, [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) has released a new beer. A Smoked Porter called "Ember Ale", it was brewed with Beech Smoked Malt from [Weyermann](http://www.weyermann.de/bra/), and Phoenix hops. Featuring a smokey flavor that "isn't overpowering", according to Picaroons Marketing Director Dennis Goodwin, it comes in at about 5% ABV with 15-20 IBUs. It will be served exclusively at the King Street Ale House, only while supplies last. A cask of it will also make an appearance at the sold out [Ladies Beer League Cask Event](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/ladies-beer-league-cask-night-at-the-stubborn-goat-november-17th/) at the [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) in Halifax this Sunday.

• Last week, [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) released a new beer on tap at their [brewpub](http://restaurant.pumphousebrewery.ca/) in downtown Moncton. A [Schwarzbier](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style04.php#1c) (sometimes known as a German black lager), the brewery describes it as having "subtle hints of chocolate and coffee leading into a light-bodied, clean finish". A great beer style to ease non-dark beer drinkers into, is has an ABV of 7% (higher-than-normal for this style of beer), and will be on tap for a limited time only.

• Over on PEI, the [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) released a new beer on tap exclusively at the [Gahan House](http://www.gahan.ca/). An American Pale Ale brewed at the Gahan brewpub, Long Creek Late Harvest is brewed with locally grown hops. While Gahan has not indicated which variety(ies) of hops were used, they describe the beer as "fully filtered, with a dark orange color". The ABV clocks in at 6.5%.

• [Sea Level Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/SeaLevelBrewing) has released their latest seasonal beer, "Crossing Muddy Waters Brown Ale". From brewmaster Randy Lawrence, we heard that the name originated from playing as a child: when out with friends, crossing one of the many bridges over the Acadia dykelands and tidal rivers, they would always yell, "We're crossing muddy waters!". This highly anticipated seasonal beer is a medium bodied ale with medium maltiness provided by chocolate and caramel malts. It is balanced with a subtle hop flavour from the Mosaic hop. A nicely rounded, easy drinking North American style Brown Ale. It clocks in at 5.5% ABV and 40 IBUs. Cans will be traveling to the city today, supplying [Bishops Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/), [Cristall Wine Merchants](http://www.cristallwinemerchants.com/store/) and [Harvest Wines and Spirits](https://www.facebook.com/harvestwines). At the brewery in Port Williams, there are six pack cans and 1 Litre refillable growlers available. Their very popular Mojo Rojo Red Ale will be back in growlers and cans shortly. Keep up with the latest info on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SeaLevelBrewing) page, too.

• [Rogues Roost Brewpub](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) has their new Cream Ale on tap and available in growlers. Clocking in at 4.5% ABV and 25 IBUs, the Golden ale features quenching and delicate flavour, with the Czech Saaz hops giving it a light body with a hint of floral aroma.

• After previously announcing that they would no longer be attending the [Historic Farmers' Market](http://www.historicfarmersmarket.ca/) in Halifax, [Bridge Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BridgeBrewing) has confirmed that they will be at the [Alderney Landing Farmers' Market](http://www.alderneylanding.com/market/) in Dartmouth. The market runs Saturday morning 8am-1pm, and Bridge will have all five of their beer available, as well as glassware. For those afraid to ferry over to the Darkside, the brewery is open weekends 12-9 Saturday, and Sunday from 12 to 6.

• [Stillwell Beer Bar](https://www.facebook.com/barstillwell) in Halifax is opening this weekend! Beginning Saturday, the much-anticipated craft beer bar will open its doors at [1672 Barrington Street](http://goo.gl/maps/JzZLF), and delight us with great craft beer from the Maritimes and beyond. Hours are M-S 4pm-2am (closed Tuesday), Sunday 11-11. We'll see you there! We'll have a report from opening weekend shortly, feel free to remind yourself how far its come from an [earlier post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/stillwell-beer-bar/).

• A little ahead of schedule, [Rare Bird](http://www.rarebirdbeer.com/) Pale Ale is showing up in [NSLCs](http://www.mynslc.com/Pages/ProductAvailability.aspx?ProductId=1018459) across the province, from Yarmouth to Sydney, Amherst to Porter's Lake. We'll have a full report from the brewery and brewmaster next week, so in the meantime, pick up a bottle and enjoy!

• News from another new brewery, [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://schoolhousebrewery.ca/), is coming in. They will be opening in April 2014 in West Hants, Nova Scotia. Owner Cam Hartley will be keeping us up to date on their progress over the fall and winter. Right now, however, they are [looking for a brewer](http://discussions.probrewer.com/showthread.php?34315-Multi-talented-brew-genius-wanted-for-nanobrewery-in-Nova-Scotia-Canada) to join the Schoolhouse team. Check out their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SchoohouseBrewery) page to get all of the latest info.

• [Big Spruce Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) in Cape Breton showed off a very slick [forged steel dual-growler holder](pic.twitter.com/8tFfnhu49z) earlier this week, available at the brewery. It brought to mind that we should put together a holiday gift-giving guide for the favourite beer drinker in your life. Look for that in a couple of weeks, and if you have any suggestions, send them in!
