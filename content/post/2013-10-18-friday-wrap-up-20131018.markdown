Good morning folks! Who feels like some beer news?

• On Sunday, November 10th, the [Fredericton Poutine Festival](http://frederictonpoutinefestival.weebly.com/) will be held at the Delta Fredericton. Featuring all-you-can-eat poutine (over ten different types from four establishments), there are two sessions: a "Family Session" ($25) from 12pm-3pm, and a "Beer Session" from 6pm-9pm. The Beer Session has two options - a regular ticket ($35) that provides four 4 oz beer samples (in addition to the standard unlimited poutine and non-alcoholic beverages), and a "Beer Experience" ($45) ticket that gives you twelve 4 oz beer samples. At least 15 different beers from local breweries [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307), [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/), and [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) will be poured, as well as from [McAuslan Brewery](http://mcauslan.com/en/) and [McClelland Premium Imports](http://www.mcclellandbeers.ca/). Tickets can be purchased [here](http://frederictonpoutinefestival.weebly.com/tickets.html); the event is already over 85% sold-out, so don't wait much longer to get your ticket!

• This evening,  the [PEI Beer Guy](http://www.peibeerguy.com/) is hosting a [beer tasting](https://www.facebook.com/events/203486899831995/) at [The Landing Oyster House and Pub](https://www.facebook.com/TheLandingPub) in Tyne Valley, PEI. It will feature six beers of all different styles, paired with food from The Landing's kitchen. Stephen was kind enough to give us a preview of the beer: [Blanche de Chambly](http://www.unibroue.com/en/beers/3) (a Belgian-style Witbier), [AffIigem Blond](http://www.affligembeer.be/) (a Belgian Blond), [Gahan's Pumpkin Ale](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) (a dunkelweizen with pumpkin), [St. Ambroise](http://st-ambroise.mcauslan.com/en/)'s Oatmeal Stout, [Barnone](https://twitter.com/BARNONEBEER)'s IPA, and [Mort Subite](http://www.mort-subite.be/fr/getpage.asp?i=1) Kriek (a cherry lambic). As he told us, this is probably the first time a sour beer has been available in a restaurant or bar in PEI. Tickets are a steal at $30, so buy them [online here](https://peibeerclub.eventbrite.com/), or call The Landing (902-831-2992) for details.

• Good news for craft beer fans in Moncton: [Celtic Knot Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) now has all four of their beers in rotation at both [The Tide and Boar](https://www.facebook.com/tideandboar) and [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/). Hopicide, Not-Joe-Average, Dark Passage and Dubh Loki will all be cycling through on tap at both locations, so stay tuned to their Facebook pages to find out when your favorite(s) is/are available!

• A new beer is now available at the [Hart & Thistle Gastropub](http://www.hartandthistle.com/) on the Halifax Waterfront. [Dank & Stormy](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.com/2013/10/dank-stormy.html) is a juicy double IPA, weighing in at 8.2% and 83 IBUs (courtesy of lots of Centennial, Cascade and Columbus varietals). The hopping rate is massive at 6.2lb/barrel (over half a kilo per 23L homebrew batch), which means lots of late and dry hops to live up to its Dank name. The [TubberRoe Robust Porter](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.com/2013/09/tubberroe-robust-porter.html) is still on as well, but who knows for how long!

• Also from the mind of [Greg Nash](https://twitter.com/__NASH__), we have further information on his beer to appear at the [Cask Days](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/3721/) in Toronto this weekend. His IPA was actually brewed on the 10 gallon pilot system at [Uncle Leo's Brewe](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/)ry in Lyons Brook. An American-style IPA, weighing in at 6.8% and 66 IBUs, and a nice golden colour (7 SRM). That sounds like a great beer for a cask.

• The Belgian Rye IPA from [Grimross Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) that we [reported on last week](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/friday-wrap-up-20131011/) is still available for growler fills at the [Picaroons Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133), and we now have some more information on the beer from owner/brewer Stephen Dixon. A rye IPA fermented with Belgian yeast, it pours a copper-brown color, and has aromas of orange, floral and candy. Hopped with Cascade, Willamette and Amarillo, and dry-hopped with Amarillo alone, it finishes quite dry, while exhibiting flavors of "rustic rye and spice". The beer weighs in at 6% ABV.

• [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) has extended their retail hours, so it should be easier for Halifax residents to drop by to purchase growlers, party kegs, and brewery swag. They are now open from 12-9 on Fridays and Saturdays, and Sundays from 12-6. Wednesday and Thursday hours remain the same, 12-7.

• After a successful soft launch earlier this week, the [Stubborn Goat Gastropub](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) will be opening today at 6pm. Reports from the event were very positive, and we hope to have a full report on the beer and food offerings for you shortly. In the meantime, follow along at their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/StubbornGoat) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheStubbornGoat) pages.

• If you do not already have plans for this evening, there is a [Winemaker vs. Brewmaster Dinner](http://winemakervsbrewmaster.eventbrite.ca/) taking place at the Halifax Club. Beginning at 6pm, the $89 event allows the two Masters ([Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/)'s Brewmaster Bobby Zacharias and [Blomidon Estate](http://blomidonwine.ca/) Winemaker Simon Rafuse) to show off how well their drinks pair with the five courses of food prepared by the [Halifax Club](http://www.halifaxclub.ns.ca/)'s Chef Nelson.

• After an extremely successful summer with no time to breathe, [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) is finally ready for their Grand Opening! Saturday, October 26, from 12-6pm at their brewery at [78 Ohio Road, Shelburne, NS](http://goo.gl/maps/XMYeK) will be a fun afternoon of celebration, with tours and tastings for adults and face painting for the kids. The official ribbon cutting will take place at 12:15pm, and tours starting at 12:30, 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, and 4:30. To make reservations for tours please call 494-9233 ext. 3 Tuesday - Saturday from 12-6. Congratulations to Emily and Henry and the entire Boxing Rock Family!

• We received some insider information that this weekend's [Rockbottom](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) Firkin will be a London-style Porter.  Head on down at 1pm Saturday for the tapping of the firkin.

• Today, the folks from [Crannóg Ales](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Crann%C3%B3g-Ales/147130382004277) are visiting Jeremy and the gang at [Big Spruce](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) to brew up a collaboration beer. The two Organic breweries (the only in the country) will brew an Imperial IPA, that will feature BC Galena and Cascade hops, grown on Crannóg's hopfield. Check their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) throughout the day for pics of the action, and then the brewery in a few weeks to buy growlers of this tasty coast-to-coast collab.
