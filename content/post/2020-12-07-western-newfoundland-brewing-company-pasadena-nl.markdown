Western Newfoundland Brewing Company opened in December 2016 in Pasadena, Newfoundland, mid-way between Corner Brook and Deer Lake.




**Can you tell us a little bit about yourselves?
**Western Newfoundland Brewing Company is Jennifer Galliott, Jim MacDonald and Norm MacDonald. Together we've been developing the concept and product for this company for about three years.


**How did you get into the world of craft beer?
**The idea of starting a brewery had been rattling around in our heads individually for quite some time.
Realizing that we all had the same idea and drive as well as the ability to groan at each other's horrible jokes, we found that each person filled a professional gap needed for starting a brewery.
The industry has grown remarkably well in other regions. Western Newfoundland seemed like an obvious fit. From there the road has been plenty of research and practice, business plans, and development meetings.

**Can you share some of your homebrewing history?
**While we have always been beer lovers, our homebrewing experience wasn’t exactly at the expert level. We had brewed ales from extract and a couple small all-grain batches in the kitchen, and there was some unidentifiable toxin that Jenn made behind her fridge, but nothing too refined. We decided in early 2014 to try and develop a few beer types that would sell well in Newfoundland. Something different but accessible, refreshing and flavourful. It was later that year when we invested in a small R&D brewing system that we began to design products in earnest.

**What made you decide to take the step into brewing professionally?
**After having a look at the significant growth pattern of micro breweries in other regions in North America, and the need for growth in our rural area, we figured an independent brewery was an obvious choice. Beer seems to sell well nearly everywhere it’s produced. People understand that the components of beer are simple at heart and that a wonderful product can be brewed from these basic components. There’s a tangible quality difference between small-batch brewed beer vs heavily filtered and pasteurized products from the big guys. This characteristic makes for a good fit with the traditional and independent nature of Western Newfoundland, both in its landscape and its people.

**What type of system are you using?
**Our system is very small to start, a Sabco Brew-Magic system. We plan to brew 300 per day, filling our multiple fermenters. This is essentially a year-1 pilot project at this stage.

**What are your plans for distribution?
**We intend to focus regionally to start. First Gros Morne and the Humber Valley, through Corner Brook. Then across the island as appropriate. We’ll move into cans as soon as is feasible.

**Do you have some initial accounts in the area lined up to serve your beers?
**We won’t be doing any on-site sales to start, but Galliott Studios is our de-facto tap room. We also plan to be in the Cat Stop in Norris Point and the Ocean View Hotel in Rocky Harbour.

**Can you tell us about the beer you are currently brewing? Any plans for seasonals?**
We’ll be starting with a ‘flag-ship’ line-up of two ales.
_Killdevil Pale Ale_: Brewed with Pale and Vienna Malts. Light in colour with a full body and a luscious creamy head. Generously hopped with Centennial and Citra hops for tangy flavours of grapefruit and pine.
_Wild Cove Cream Ale_: A smooth, full bodied brew with a creamy head and tawny copper colour. The flavour is bready with herbal, spicy notes. Brewed with Pale and Munich Malts and moderately hopped with Nugget and Tettnang.
We absolutely intend to expand to a broader seasonal line as our capacity allows.

**Have you had any assistance from other breweries in Atlantic Canada?
**During our research, we have met with a lot of breweries within the Atlantic provinces. All of them have been such a great help, and have been kindly willing to share with us their knowledge, encouragement and pints.

**Where do you hope to see your brewery in the next few years?
**In few years, we certainly hope to have wide-distribution across Western Newfoundland. After year 3 we would like to begin distributing province-wide.
We are also excited to see other breweries opening around the same time or shortly after our own. The more independent brewers established in the province, the better.

**Do you have a favorite beer style, beer, or brewery you enjoy drinking?**
There’s a right beer for every occasion! But we are all particular fans of English bitters, porters, stouts, cream ales, pale ales, IPAs, amber lagers, pale lagers, Canadian lagers, pilsners, Scottish ales, Irish ales, Dunkels, Oktoberfests, Flanders, Meads, Ciders, Tripels, and probably a few others.

**How about favourite style or ingredient to brew with?**
At this stage in the game we’re still in awe of how versatile the pale ale can be. Munich malt smells like heaven during the mash.
