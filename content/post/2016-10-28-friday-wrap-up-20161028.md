Happy Friday folks! Before you bolt out the door to don your costume and drink beer straight from a pumpkin, check out the latest beers and events in our region this week.

• [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) released a new beer earlier this week, the name of which is almost as hard to type as it is to say - _HFXtraterrestrials StankoniAle_ (God bless copy and paste!). Described by the brewery as a "fruity wheat with southern heat", think of it as a spicy Berliner Weisse. The grist is composed simply of Wheat and Pilsner malt, with a bit of Acidulated malt thrown in to lower the pH. Hopped entirely with **Sorachi Ace**, further additions of lemon zest, orange zest, and red Thai chilies help round out both the aroma and flavour with more fruit characteristics, as well as heat. This golden, hazy, effervescent beer was launched on Wednesday during their [Player's Ball](https://www.facebook.com/events/1136703893081171/) event, accompanied by music, soul food, and classic cars. Super-sessionable at just 4% ABV, it's still on tap now at the brewery taproom; you'll likely see it across the HRM this weekend as well. Be sure to check our Events listing below for GR's busy weekend.

• There's a brand new beer on tap at the [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co-301456876447/) brewpub, _ALTar MatrimoniAle_, which was brewed with [Uncorked Tours](http://www.uncorkednb.com/)' own Gilliane Nadeau earlier this month. Launched at Nadeau's engagement party at the brewpub, it's an Altbier that was lagered for a short while, in order to mimic how the beer style was originally brewed when it originated in Germany. Amber-coloured, and drinkable in quantity at 4.8% ABV and 42 IBUs, featuring Pale Ale and Caramunich malts, with Noble hops for a well-balanced brew. The beer is available for pints and growlers now, and will be making a return next summer to celebrate Nadeau's wedding.

• [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) has brought back _Good Aura_, hitting taps earlier this week. This hoppy Amber Ale was originally brewed in honour of Aura, the beloved dog of Dan Mason, TrailWay's co-brewer and co-owner, a rescue pup from the Fredericton SPCA. The beer has a grist with multiple malts, including Crystal, Munich and Rye, giving it an amber-coloured (and, of course, hazy!) appearance. Hopped with plenty of **Mosaic** and **Summit**, this 7% ale combines the best-of-both-worlds from both the American Amber and American IPA styles. Every time _Good Aura_ is brewed, TrailWay will make a donation to the Fredericton SPCA.

• Up on the Rock this week, [YellowBelly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com) has released a variation on their tried and true namesake _Pale Ale_. Normally kettle hopped with **Nugget**, **Cluster**, and **Super Styrians** and then dry-hopped with **Ahtanum** to accentuate piney, floral and citrus notes, this batch is solely smashed with **Mosaic** (HBC 369) hops from start to finish, yielding heavy resinous, piney, tropical and citrusy flavours. Beautifully described by Brewmaster Liam McKenna himself with the note, “Smells like a frisky ocelot in a pine forest eating a massive tropical and citrus fruit salad,” it has all the hallmarks of the original (a sessionable 4.5% and a reasonable 40 IBU). Speaking of the original, we are assured that the standard _YellowBelly Pale Ale_ will continue to be served alongside this batch, but for those with a nose for the modern, dank, citrus and tropical mashup that is Mosaic, it’s available now in the pub and hopefully next week in bottles.

• The new, experimental beers continue to roll out of the General Store, the [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) Saint John headquarters. Now on tap is _The Power's Out Pumpkin Ale_, brewed in "honour" of the frequent power issues the location has experienced since opening. Brewed with real pumpkin and "healthy, though not overwhelming" amounts of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice, this is quite-sessionable take on the Pumpkin Ale style, weighing in at just 4.7% ABV. As with their other special releases, this is available on tap only at the General Store, and for a very limited time, so drop by for your taste ASAP!

• As we mentioned [last week](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/10/21/friday-wrap-up-20161021/), check the taps, and shelves, for a bevvy of returning favourites from [Tatamagouche](http://tatabrew.com/) this week: _Blue Bales_, their Blueberry Wheat returns with the harvest berries, resulting in a softer and sweeter finish than the earlier batch; _Full Circle_ American Wheat, first brewed last year with help from the crew at [Field Guide](http://fieldguidehfx.com/), featuring Tata's own **Cascade** hops, aided by some late **Huell Melon** and **Mandarina Bavaria** for a big candied citrus aroma; and _Ging' Sync: Rye, Rye, Rye_, brewed with more than 5 kg of ginger in the kettle and hopback to complement the [Horton Ridge Malt](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) Rye used in the grain bill. Growler fills and cans of all three are available now at the brewery, and these will be showing up on the taps around HRM this weekend.

• Nackawic's [Big Axe Brewery](http://www.bigaxe.ca/) has released a new beer this weekend, a _Peanut Butter Chocolate Milk Stout_. Modeled after the favourite Hallowe'en (and year-round) peanut butter and chocolate cup treat, this 5.2% ABV beer has a lighter body than their _Shakesbeer Chocolate Oatmeal Stout_, with a nice caramel malt and ligth roast, with the addition of lactose gives a slightly sweeter flavour, giving a nice base to the significant PB aroma and flavour. Actual Reese cups were added to the brew, as well as dark chocolate. It will be available in Fredericton at Isaac's Way and the James Joyce pub, and a single keg heading to Cask and Kettle in Saint John. And for those who make the trip to Nackawic, those who show up in costume this weekend will receive a 10% discount on pints.

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is launching a pair of beers this weekend. Returning for the season, just in time for International Stout Day on Nov 3, is _Martello _Stout. Weighing in at 5.0% ABV and 30 IBUs, it features lots of roast, chocolate and coffee characteristics. Available at the brewery now, and at the NSLC and private stores shortly. The second launch of the day is _Test Batch - Code Name: Juicy_. This 8.0% Double IPA features a tons of **Citra**, **Ella**, and **Mosaic **hops, to the tune of 75 IBUs, for a floral and fruity blast from these special varietals. This test batch is only available in 650 ml bottles at the brewery now.

• And in upcoming brewery news, [Half Cocked Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/halfcockedbrewing/) has jumped onto the scene in [North Grant](https://goo.gl/maps/uMpH5PBwbqv), NS, near Antigonish. Local brothers Dave and Greg Oicle, together with partners Matt Thomson and Ryan MacPherson, will set up on an old chicken farm (hence the name...), which they have already prepped to begin growing hops in the spring. Long time homebrewers, they are currently working with a [Sabco Brew-Magic](https://www.brewmagic.com/) system, a favourite for small and pilot breweries in our region. Follow along on their progress toward opening in the spring on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/halfcockedbrewing/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/halfcockedbeer), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/halfcockedbrewing/), and we'll grab the full scoop from them closer to launch.

Check out these events happening this weekend, and in the near future:

• Happening **right now**, is the inaugural brewday for the [Gander Homebrew Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/223851571366277/). Spearheaded by Sam Newman, one of the principals of the in-development [Scudrunner Brewing](http://www.scudrunnerbrewing.ca/), and David Jerrett, the group and event are a way for local beer enthusiasts to get together and share their love of the hobby. Brewers, and fans, of all skill and interest level are encouraged to drop by to meet, lend a hand, and make plans for future brewdays (and the beer nights that follow). More details can be found at their [FB event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/704111409755915/), and you can reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ScudrunnerBrew) to find the location details. And look for Scudrunner to launch their brewery in Gander in Spring 2017.

• Fredericton's [James Joyce Irish Pub](https://www.facebook.com/The-James-Joyce-Pub-187205728006725/?fref=ts) has an exciting new addition to their 20+ tap lines - cask ale! They're officially launching the option of purchasing "cask ale" - beer that is packaged in a pin or firkin before fermentation is complete, allowing it to finish and carbonate in the cask from which it will be served. It is usually less-carbed than kegged beer, and served via hand pump. To celebrate the addition to their lineup, they are holding an [event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1870109839868053) **tonight**, starting at 5:00 pm. A couple of special [Maybee Brewing](http://www.maybeebrew.com/) casks will be on, their _Work Horse IPA_ and _Stone House Tripel_, both of which have been aging with _Brettanomyces_ yeast. The pub plans to run casks on a daily basis, once a steady supply starts trickling in. There's no cover to attend tonight, just show up and pay by the glass! And be sure to drop by Maybee's spot **Saturday** after 6:00 pm for live music, and the launch of their Top Secret Hallowe'en beer, _Give up the Gose_, a 4.5 % ABV German-style sour, brewed with coriander and sea salt, with a unique twist of Chocolate Wheat malt for an unexpected dark appearance.

• After a busy inaugural summer season, the [Port Rexton Brewing](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) tap room will closing this weekend. To ensure they cap the season in style, they are holding a [Hallowe'en Bash](https://www.facebook.com/portrextonbrewing/photos/a.1653916061562519.1073741828.1633109666976492/1779333482354109/?type=3&theater) **October 29th**. Show up in your best costume at 7pm, and party the night away at your friendly local taproom. And for those making the trip from Town, there are a pair of nearby spots still open for the season, where you can rest your head. [Fishers' Loft](http://fishersloft.com/) (with whom they brewed the _Gardener's Gose_) is nearby for your accommodation needs, as is [Sherwood Suites](http://www.sherwoodsuites.com/). And fear not, PR fans, with the tap room closing, that just means more opportunities to grab a pint in town. Keep an eye on their social media to see when and where their next kegs will drop!

• Halifax's [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) are holding a series of events this weekend to celebrate Hallowe'en as well.
**Friday**: [Electric Circuit Party](https://www.facebook.com/events/327555680937812), 10:00 pm. Retro dance party to kick off the weekend.

This ticketed event is sold out, but the doors will be open to the public at 10pm. [Black Sheep Restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/blacksheephalifax/) will be serving food onsite.

• Those within striking distance of the Metro Halifax area are reminded of the [Battery Park Beer Bar’s](http://batterypark.ca/) second tap takeover, this time featuring [Boxing Rock Brewing Co.](http://boxingrock.ca/), happening in Dartmouth on Thursday, **November 3rd**. It will feature familiar favourites, fondly-remembered (or possibly forgotten) brews from seasons past and some brand new bangers. You’ll definitely be seeing the return of _Hop Springs Eternal White IPA_, created as an entry for this year’s Black Box Challenge competition, _Over the Top_, the Cranberry Sour from this summer and _For the Love of Grimace_, the Blueberry Berliner Weiss collaboration with [Big Spruce Brewing](http://bigspruce.ca/). Rumor has it you’ll also see a brand new collaboration between Battery Park and Boxing Rock, in the form of an India Brown Ale. Plenty more taps are yet to be announced, keep an eye on social media (especially [@BatteryBeerBar](https://twitter.com/BatteryBeerBar) and [@boxingrockbeer](https://twitter.com/boxingrockbeer)) for more tap reveals as the date approaches.

• [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/) is continuing their _First Thursday Growler Evening_ next Thursday, **November 3rd**, 5 to 9 pm.

• Next weekend, on Sunday, **November 6****th**, the [Atlantic Canadian Beer Awards](https://www.facebook.com/BeerAwardsAtlantic/) Dinner & Gala will take place at the [Stubborn Goat Gastropub](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/halifax/). This is the culmination of the ACBA event and a chance to rub shoulders with both your favourite brewers as well, no doubt, as a few of the region’s beer cognoscenti as they converge for a multi-course dinner expertly paired with some of the region’s award-winning beers. The event starts at 6pm with dinner served at seven. [Tickets for the event](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/atlantic-canadian-beer-awards-dinner-gala-tickets-28865877617) are $88.50 per person (which includes gratuity, but not taxes and fees, which run about $20 more). Whether you’re up for the gala or not, we’d like to remind everyone of your chance to [vote for the People’s Choice Award](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PeoplesChoiceACBA) for the top beer and top cider in the region for 2016. The list has been kept to those beers and ciders entered in the friendly competition, otherwise it would probably top out at 1000 different different offerings.

• The Inaugural [Cape Breton Beer Fest](https://www.capebretonbeerfest.com) is happening **November 19th** at the Cruise Terminal in Sydney. There will be [thirteen breweries and cider houses](https://www.capebretonbeerfest.com/pages/become-a-vendor) from around the province in attendance for the Afternoon (2:00 to 4:30 pm) or Evening sessions (7:00 to 9:30 pm, with VIP tickets available for 6:00 pm entry).

A few more parting shots before we sign off this week:

- After a brief hiatus, [Unfiltered](http://hoppyasballs.ca) has once again released their very popular _Double Orange Ale_ (7.5% ABV, 100+ IBUs), a SMaSH beer featuring 2-row malt and Citra hops; currently on tap for fills and pints at Charm School, and finer beer bars/restaurants in the HRM and beyond.
- [ANBL Growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) stations are featuring a wide array of beers from Garrison, Pump House and breweries from outside the region this week. And they have recently expanded their growler filling station to include [Moncton North](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=Moncton+North+%2F+Nord), located at 1866 Mountain Rd, bringing the count to six locations. Look for their expansion to continue to more locations, as the growler program has certainly been a hit for the ANBL, breweries, and drinkers alike.
- [Sober Island Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/soberislandbrewing/?fref=ts)'s [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/283573177/sober-island-brewing-company) is entering its final week, giving you just a few more chances to be a part of their expansion, while grabbing some swag for yourself.
