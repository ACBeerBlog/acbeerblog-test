Happy Friday, everyone! It's shaping up to be a busy weekend in our region, so let's dive right in!

• One of the most anticipated openings of the summer will be happening this weekend (maybe even today, if the weather cooperates). The [Stillwell Beergarden](http://www.barstillwell.com/beergarden) location on Spring Garden a/k/a [#BGonSG](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BGonSG?src=hash) will be opening very, very soon. Featuring access from both Spring Garden and South Park, the bright red sea can features an expanded tap list of 10 beer and ciders, plus a pair of wines available at all times. While focusing on local beer is still the norm, look for special beers from elsewhere to be available, including [DdC!](http://dieuduciel.com/en/). To keep fans of the Barrington Mothership happy, a small rotating selection of large-format bottles will be available for sharing, and there will be non-alcoholic options too, such as Propeller Sodas. While Chef Graeme Ruppel is holding court on Barrington, sous-chef Joe Martin(i) will be driving the food options on Spring Garden, with a rotating dozen-item menu, featuring everything from tacos to kofte, weiners to noodles, all cooked over wood and charcoal, for a backyard BBQ vibe. Keep an eye on [Stilly's BG webpage](http://www.barstillwell.com/beergarden) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/BarStillwell) for today's forecast of beer and accompaniments.

• In the same space as the Beergarden, [Manual & Co](http://www.manualfoodanddrinkco.com/) will be running a Dairy Bar onsite with cool treats, pulled coffee shots, and more. Featuring new house-made soft serve and sundae options daily, they are also putting together their own popsicles and will feature cold-brewed coffee, served on a nitro tap. Open from 10-8 daily, follow along with their latest flavours and features on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dairybarhfx/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/manual_co).

• Halifax's [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released a brand new collaboration brew this week. _Graceland Too_ is a White IPA, brewed with a little help from the crew from Barrie, ON's [Flying Monkeys](http://www.flyingmonkeys.ca/). This 6.5% wheat beer features loads of hops for a solid bitterness and citrus aroma, complementing the weizen yeast characters, the same strain used in their _Hefeweizen_. The beer is available is bottles now at both the Gottingen and Windmill locations, and will see limited release in kegs and cask around the city. Due to the small batch size, it may not last long enough to make it to their growler filling stations, so be sure to drop by today for satisfaction.

• St John's [YellowBelly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) has released a new beer this week. _Summer Wheat_ is a different take on their _Wexford Wheat_, featuring a different hopping bill, incorporating **Sorachi Ace**. That hop gives off notes of lemon, dill, and flowers, on a medium-light wheat character. At 4.5% ABV and 22 IBUs, it will be perfect for the coming warmer days. The beer is available on tap now, and due to the small batch size, will not be available in bottles.

• [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) has released a brand new beer, _American Oatmeal_. Brewed with a healthy amount of Flaked Oats, some Brown malt was also added to the grist to contribute to the roast character of the beer. It weighs in at 6.2% ABV and is available at the brewery taproom now, as well as select accounts in Fredericton. And while there, be sure to try out the new iteration of their _Session IPA_, brewed with a different hop schedule, featuring a mix of Australian and American hop varieties (including a sizable dry hop). 4.3% and about 40 IBUs. Finally, the taproom patio should be opening today, which offers plenty of additional, outdoor seating, to help keep up with the crowds that have been turning out for a pint or three! [Milda's Pizza](http://mildaspizzas.com/) will be in attendance from 4:30-8 today to keep you satisfied. And tomorrow will see the brand new [Country Fried Wontons](https://www.facebook.com/Countryfriedwontons/) truck drop by to provide nourishment from 4:30-8:30.

• Newly-opened [Annapolis Cider Company](http://drinkannapolis.ca/) has a new cider on tap, _Rhubarb Ginger_. Freshly-pressed rhubarb and juiced ginger give this unfiltered 6.7% ABV cider a hazy look, and a tasty blend of aromas and flavours. This "Something Different" batch is the first in their plan of passing along $0.50 for every refill to a local charitable organization. This batch's beneficiary is the [Nova Scotia Nature Trust](http://www.nsnt.ca/) which is dedicated to protecting, forever, Nova Scotia's most unique, rare and treasured natural areas through land conservation. Drop by Annapolis' Wolfville location for a fill today!

• In tribute to this year's [OUTeast Film Festival](http://www.outeastfilm.com/#aboutindex) in Halifax (June 16th-19th), [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) released a new beer, of sorts, yesterday. _Shocking Pinks_ is a blend of their regular-lineup _Goseface Killah_ Gose with pink lemonade and hibiscus tea. Described by the brewery as "tart, floral and fruity", this 4.8% ABV blend is available now on tap at the Good Robot taproom, and at many of the OUTeast events over the weekend.

• Edmundston's [Brasseurs Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/) has released their Summer 2016 seasonal this week. _Lt. Ingall_ Cream Ale is 4.3% ABV light-bodied beer, with a nice aromatic punch from the use of **Galaxy**, in a quaffable package. The beer will be available exclusively at their Brewtique for pints and growler fills, and at next weekend's [Edmundston Jazz and Blues Festival](http://www.jazzbluesedmundston.com/en/index.php).

• [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) is celebrating their Second Anniversary this weekend, with some special brewery-only deals and beers available. Starting **today**, they will be pouring their [CBA-medal winning](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) _Two Rivers_ Baltic Porter, and a special cask of their _Deception Bay_ IPA, conditioned on nectarines. Look for a special beer brewed with grist from [Horton Ridge Malt](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) to be released late next week. This SMaSH (Single Malt and Single Hop) features the Annapolis Valley's Organic Pale Ale malt, and hopped with **Amarillo**. And in early July, keep an eye out for a Session IPA brewed with the crew from Halifax's Bishop's Cellar, featuring **Mosaic**, **Hallertau Blanc** and a small addition of **Amarillo**.

• We now have more details on the 1st Anniversary beer being released by [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) next Friday, June 24th, during their [1st Anniversary event weekend](https://www.facebook.com/events/283782431966688/). A Belgian Saison (aka Farmhouse Ale), _De Novo I_ was brewed with a simple grist of Maritime Malt, hopped with Goldings harvested in New Brunswick, and fermented with two yeast strains: a _Saccharomyces_ strain, and a _Brettanomyces_ yeast blend from Escarpment labs in Ontario. Weighing in at 6% ABV, the brewery describes the beer as having "light candy and funky flavours", with a dry finish. The beer will be available in bottles and on tap exclusively at the Upstreet taproom, and will be released **June 24th** at 6 pm, at the beginning of the Anniversary Beer Launch & Vinyl Party. Tickets are still available for their [Field Trip](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/the-upstreet-field-trip-tickets-25726193738), starting Saturday **June 25** @ 6pm, featuring stops at 5 locations, with samples at each, ending up at The Alley for bowling and beer and food and music.

• Halifax's [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/) is bringing back two favourite hopbombs today. The _Double Orange Ale_ (_DOA_) Double IPA is a SMaSH beer weighing in at 7.5% ABV and 100+ IBUs, getting its eponymous colour from a Nash-special technique, using only 2-Row malt and **Citra** hops. The _Riddle of Steel_ IPA is slightly lighter, boasting 7.0% ABV and about 70 IBUs, in a West Coast IPA meets East Coast yeast. Both beers are available now for growler fills, at 4pm at Charm School next door for pints, and soon at beer bars in the region.

• [Mill Street Brewpub](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) has opened on the St John's waterfront. Tied closely to the new [Bier Markt](http://www.thebiermarkt.com/st-johns/) location, they are brewing beer onsite, and supplementing the standard offerings from the Labatt-owned Mill Street line. We'll have more details on the beers and brewhouse very soon.

• Congratulations to the crew from [Beerocracy](https://www.facebook.com/beerocracymovie), whose [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/beerocracy#/) ended successfully early this morning! Look for this movie love letter to NB beer to be released in the fall in breweries, bars, and events around the province. To thank their great supporters, they have released a short movie, _Ciderocracy_, which will be featured in the film. [Check it out now](https://vimeo.com/169302583)!

• In a story we mentioned in [November](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/11/27/friday-wrap-up-20151127/), the small-batch brews produced by AB-InBev at their [Alexander Keith's Brewery](http://keiths.ca/#/) on [Lower Water Street](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alexander-Keiths-Brewery/104201766282701) in Halifax are now available. Brewing on a 20 hl system, Brewmaster Stefan Gagliardi has put together recipes inspired by the original beers brewed by Alexander Keith in the city. Studying as a Chemical Engineer, he turned his focus to beer a decade ago, working in Quality Assurance, and then managing the brewhouse in St John's, NL. After a move to Halifax's Oland Brewery as Quality Manager, he is now in charge of the Historic Keith's Brewery production. Says Gagliardi, "Brewing is my creative outlet. I have always been inspired by experimenting with beer styles and interesting ingredients and will bring this passion to the original brewery. I am constantly inspired by the story of Alexander Keith’s brewery, and the local community and culture in Halifax. Alexander Keith’s has such strong roots here and that inspiration will never stop being part of the beer that is produced in this historic facility." On what inspires the recipes, Gagliardi says, "We look at three points for inspirations – our heritage and history, local ingredients and finally great tasting and innovative ingredients. The great thing about the original Alexander Keith’s brewery is that it gives us the opportunity to develop small-batch brews that are new and exciting, and most importantly unique to the east coast. Innovation has always been part of our heritage and we’re excited to bring new flavours and styles to Nova Scotia beer lovers."
Their flagship beer is _Cornerstone Edinburgh Pale Ale_, a 4.3% ABV, 30 IBU, brewed with a base of Golden Promise, and enhanced with a blend of **Cara** malts from Weyermann: Cara Red, Cara Malt and CaraFoam, for colour, flavour, and body. The hops chosen were UK** East Kent Goldings**, **Fuggles**, and Hallertauer** Perle**, for a traditional English Ale hopping schedule. Also available now is _Alexander Keith’s Lunenburg Coffee and Cacao Stout_, a 6.5% ABV full-bodied stout, featuring 5kg of [Laughing Whale](http://www.laughingwhalecoffee.com/) coffee in the mash, and 11 kg of cacao nibs directly in the boil. Golden Promise base malt, with Cara Malt, Chocolate, Special B and roasted barley lend the iconic colour and flavours.
The beers will be available the NSLC and ANBL in 6-pack and 650mL bottles, on tap at bars and restaurants around Nova Scotia, and for growler fills at the Historic Keith's Brewery.

• After the success of the last summer's inaugural [Tasting NB](https://www.facebook.com/events/1745077322415797/) in Fredericton, this year's event has been scheduled for **Saturday, July 9th**.

A few parting shots this week:

- Fredericton's [Grimross Brewery](http://grimross.com/) looking for part-time staff in the Taproom and Retail operations. Send them an [email](mailto:stephen@grimross.com), or drop your resume at their taproom location.
- [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) also looking for staff, Sales Associates at their Cider House and Farmers Market stalls. Again, drop them an [email](mailto:jobs@redroverbrew.com) for more details.
- Halifax's [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) is releasing a small run of their _Millie_ Beet Saison, a Stillwell collaboration beer. This time around, this 5.0% ABV brew will only be available in 750's at the brewery and Battery Park location, beginning today, so drop by for a take-away.
-  Lyons Brook's [Uncle Leo's](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/) released their very popular _Voh's Weizenbier_ late last week. This 5.0% Hefeweizen is brewed with a traditional weizen yeast, and lots of wheat, for an unfiltered beer reminiscent of this classic German style. As there are only a few bottles left at the brewery, your best bet will be to find it out in the wild at better beer bars, and RockHead, in Halifax and Pictou County, and at the Townhouse in Antigonish.
- [Garrison's](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) _Seaport Blonde_ is back at the brewery, and in the wild. This 4.0% Blonde features **Columbus** hops, and a light body from 2-Row and Wheat malts. It is available now in 6-packs at the brewery and NSLC, and growler fills.
