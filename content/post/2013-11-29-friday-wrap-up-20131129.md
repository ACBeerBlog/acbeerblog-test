Another last Friday! Here's your Atlantic Canadian beer news for the week:

• [Propeller Brewing's](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) Revolution Russian Imperial Stout hits shelves today. Brewed to 8% and 60 IBUs, it features Roasted, Crystal and Chocolate Malts for a full bodied mouthfeel and great flavour and aroma, and Warrior and Cascade hops for bittering and aroma. It will be available at both the [Halifax](http://goo.gl/maps/3wAEf) and [Dartmouth](http://goo.gl/maps/XeKKI) breweries in 1 and 1.89L growlers, and in 500mL bottles at the breweries, NSLC and private beer stores.

• Also available today is the [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) Premium Pilsner mentioned in [last week's Wrap-Up](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/22/friday-wrap-up-20131122/). This initial launch of the beer will be in the form of a gift box, containing one 750 mL swing-top bottle. Only 2000 bottles will be available to the public, and can be purchased at [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) and [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/) stores, as well as at the brewery locations in Moncton (Mill Road and Orange Lange). Look for Premium Pilsner to be available in May or June of 2014 as one of Pump House's seasonal beers, in the standard 12-oz bottle size.

• Brewmaster [Nash](https://twitter.com/__Nash__) at [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) in Halifax has released a new batch of an old favourite beer, the Wreckoning Russian Imperial Stout. It features loads of dark malts, including Crystal 150, Black Patent and Chocolate Malt, and is hopped fairly aggressively to 2 lbs/barrel. Some of the beer was then aged in Glenora 12-yr barrels, and fortified with Woodford Reserve Bourbon, and blended back to give you loads of chocolate, vanilla and dark fruit aromas to complement the oak and bourbon. Weighing in at 10%ABV and 132 IBUs (calc), this is a big black beauty of a beer, and only available on tap. And remember to drop by Saturday afternoon for their weekly Firkin, where Nash serves up a special small batch of beer from a gravity fed cask.

• [Rogues Roost](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) Brewpub in Halifax also has a favourite beer back on tap, their Raspberry Wheat. The beer clocks in at 4.6% and 15IBUs, and features loads of raspberry aroma and flavour. While it isn't currently available in growlers, their IPA and Red Ale are, but that list is always expanding. Check their [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/Rogues_Roost) for up-to-the-minute news, and food and beer specials.

• [Last week](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/22/friday-wrap-up-20131122/) we posted info on [Big Spruce](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing)'s new collaboration beer with [Crannóg Ale](http://www.crannogales.com/), Left Breton Organic Conspiracy Imperial IPA; well, the beer went on tap at Halifax's [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) shortly thereafter! It probably won't last long, but it may be back soon... keep an eye on Stillwell's [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/BarStillwell) for tap list updates! Note that the beer is still available at the brewery.

• We also mentioned last week that [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) had their employees working hard to harvest all the spruce tips needed to brew their extremely popular Spruce Beer. Well, the beer was brewed last weekend, and will be bottled next Friday! The expected released date is a week later, Friday, December 13th. This year, they plan on sending some Spruce Beer to New Brunswick; look for it to arrive at ANBL stores by December 16th or so. For more details on how they brew this beer, keep your eyes on [CBC's The National](http://www.cbc.ca/thenational/) after the 13th!

• The final judging for entries in the [New Brunswick Homebrew Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/567725753265224/) is winding down, and the winner will be selected and announced from the top 5 entries at the gala this Sunday, December 1st. The homebrewer of the best-judged [Standard/Ordinary Bitter](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style08.php#1a) will get to brew their beer on a commercial-sized scale with [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons)' head brewer Andrew Estabrooks, for release at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?fref=ts) in downtown Fredericton. Good luck, finalists!

• And don't forget that tickets for the March 8th [2014 Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) go on sale today! In addition to the regular and VIP tickets ($50 and $60, respectively), there will be a limited number of "Ladies VIP" tickets sponsored by the [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague). For ladies only (obviously), these tickets will give the ticket-holder early entry (90 minutes) into the festival, along with Beer 101 with Garrison brewer Kellye Robertson, and guest presentations from local beer celebrities, or "beerlebrities" (unfortunately, I did not come up with that clever word, but... I like it!).  Priced the same as regular VIP tickets, with $10 going to a local women's charity, we'll have more details on these tickets and the rest of the festival in the near future. Buy your tickets [here](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/fredericton-craft-beer-festival-2014-tickets-8430685407?aff=BeerBlogger); don't wait, last year's event sold out quickly!
