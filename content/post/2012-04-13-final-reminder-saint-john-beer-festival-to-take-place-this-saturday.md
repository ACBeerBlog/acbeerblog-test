As per the event's Twitter account (@SJBeerFest), there are still some tickets left for this Saturday's inaugural [Saint John Beer Fest](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/beerfest). Tickets are available exclusively at Harbour Station and can be ordered over the phone at 506-657-1234 or 1-800-267-2800 or picked up at the Box Office during regular hours.  Tickets for this event cannot be ordered online.

Here is a link to a previous post about the [brewers and beers that will be available](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/full-beer-list-for-saint-john-beer-fest-now-available/).

For out of town travelers, a special Beer Fest room rate of $99 is available at the Saint John Hilton.  Either mention "Saint John Beer Fest" or "BEEA12" to qualify for the reduced rate.
