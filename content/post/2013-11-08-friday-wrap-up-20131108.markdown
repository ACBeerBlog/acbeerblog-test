Happy Friday, everybody! That means it's time for some Atlantic Canadian Beer News:

• Living in New Brunswick and waiting for an update from [Red Rover Brewing](www.redroverbrew.com/)? Well, good news... they recently announced (via an email bulletin to supporters, or "Red Roverlutionaries") that they moved into their new location - the "Ciderhouse" - in mid-September! Over the past six weeks, plenty of equipment has been trickling in, along with their first shipment of apples... about 56,000 lbs worth! They have finally received their liquor license, and should begin brewing cider as soon as juice has been pressed. While the first batches of cider likely won't be available until sometime in January, they hope to have their retail shop at the Ciderhouse open before Christmas, so you can purchase merchandise, including 1-L fliptop growlers (with refill certificates to be used when the cider is available). Right now, the plan is to have at least three different cider varieties on tap; in addition to growler fills, the cider should start popping up at different beer bars and restaurants in the province.  For those of you who aren't supporters, it's not too late to become one! Click [here](http://www.redroverbrew.com/p/want-to-be-newest-red-roverlutionary.html) for details. For more info on Red Rover, check out [our interview](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/08/red-rover-brewing-company-a-new-cidery-coming-to-fredericton/) with them from May.

• For those of you who love your dark beers... today is [International Stout Day](http://www.stoutday.com/)! It's the third year of the now-annual event, and beer bars and breweries around the world are releasing special beers and planning events to celebrate the several beer styles in the Stout family. [Garrison Brewing Co.](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is having a "Stout Day Challenge": participants can take a picture of themselves drinking Garrison's Martello Stout and tweet it with the hashtag [#MartelloStout](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MartelloStout&src=typd&f=realtime) and [#StoutDay](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23StoutDay&src=tyah) along with the beer bar/restaurant location. The winner will receive a Stout Gift Pack that includes beer, a T-shirt, and a bar towel. Get tweeting! [Mother's Pizza](http://mothershalifax.com/) in Halifax is baking some of their pies with Martello Stout, very cool!

• Also just in time for Stout Day, [Big Tide Brewing](http://www.bigtidebrew.com/) will have their Whistlepig Stout back on tap at the brewpub. Described by the brewery as a "dry American Stout", it's brewed with dark roasted malts and oatmeal, producing a "nutty, chocolate aroma" and English hops. It comes in at 4.8% ABV and 42 IBUs.

• Big Tide is also re-releasing their Tidal Wave Double IPA. This is the third time they've brewed this beer, which started out in life as a collaboration with [Greg Nash](https://twitter.com/__NASH__). It is close to 100 IBUs but really well balanced, and has lots of citrus notes from Columbus and Cascade hops. Deceptively drinkable at 9% ABV.

• [Shiretown](http://shiretownbeer.com/) also has a couple of new beers, both currently available at the brewery for growler fills. The Choke Cherry Wheat (following the release of their popular Black Currant Wheat) is brewed with their base wheat recipe and locally-grown choke cherries. "Woody, with tannins up-front", the beer has an ABV of 5% and 17 IBUs. Siren's T'ale is their new "bittersweet" Red Ale that is brewed with a variety of Caramalts; also at 5% ABV, it has slightly more bitterness (30 IBUs) to balance the sweetness from the malts. Look for this one to be available in bottles at [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/searchresults.html?bname=shiretown&x=-674&y=-51) stores by sometime in December.

• Meanwhile, in Newfoundland, the [Yellowbelly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) is about to release their newest beer. Still unnamed, it's a new Pale Ale brewed exclusively with Topaz, an Australian hop known for its intense aroma of citrus and "dank" overtones. The beer is brewed with 95% Pale malt and 5% Carastan, and has 70 IBUs and an ABV of 5.5%. It'll be available on draft only at the brewpub, and should be tapped sometime early next week.

• As we quickly mentioned in the [Ladies Beer League Cask Event](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/ladies-beer-league-cask-night-at-the-stubborn-goat-november-17th/) interview (the event is now sold out, by the way), [B](http://www.boxingrock.ca/)[oxing Rock Brewing](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has released their newest seasonal, Crafty Jack English Brown Ale. It features a rich, roasty malt profile, and classic English hops. It comes in at 4.2% and 29 IBUs. It is currently available at the brewery store in [Shelburne](http://goo.gl/maps/Up6Ho), this weekend at the [Halifax Seaport Famers' Market](http://www.halifaxfarmersmarket.com/) and next week at the private beer stores in Halifax (650mL package size).

• If you live in the Fredericton area and are looking for a job in the beer industry, [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) is currently looking for another driver to deliver beer across New Brunswick... and beyond. If you're interested, email your resume (or questions about the position) to [chris@picaroons.ca](mailto:chris@picaroons.ca).

• [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) announced last week on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BridgeBrewing) that they will no longer be attending the [Historic Farmers' Market](http://www.historicfarmersmarket.ca/) in Halifax. They hope to be at another market in the near future; in the meantime, you can still get your growlers filled and buy merchandise at the brewery on [Agricola Street](http://goo.gl/maps/PYNJ0). And remember they've extended their hours on the weekend: Sat 12-9, Sun 12-6.

• [Rare Bird Craft Beer](http://www.rarebirdpub.com/brewery/) in Guysborough will soon have their Rare Bird Pale Ale available in the NSLC, previously only available on tap or in growlers at the [Antigonish Farmers Market](http://www.antigonishfarmersmarket.org/) and [Stepping Stone Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/SkippingStoneStore). It is an East Coast interpretation of this classic beer style, using pure artesian water from Nova Scotia’s pristine Eastern Shore, Rare Bird Pale Ale starts with a nice hit of hops on the nose, a delicious balance of specially selected malted barley and both English and North American hops in the middle and a dry finish that delivers a refreshing beer of rare character, at 7.0% ABV. We will have more from Rare Bird closer to the release date.

• November 16th, the [Beerthief](http://www.beerthief.ca/) and Beckett on Wine are holding an Oktoberfest tasting and dinner at [Bitters Lounge](http://bitters.gsumun.ca/) on the MUN campus in St. John's. The dinner will feature five courses of Belgian beer and food pairings prepared by Chef Julie Purchase, lead by Tom Beckett. Tickets are $52, and can be secured by contacting Tom via [email](mailto:tom.beckett@nl.rogers.com).

• Also on the 16th, [Maison Tait House](http://www.maisontaithouse.com/) in Shediac will be hosting a beer tasting, featuring [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) beer paired with Chef Mike Harris' creations. Picaroons owner Sean Dunbar will be leading the tasting of the five pairing courses. Tickets for this event are $59, and can be secured by calling or [emailing](mailto:info@maisontaithouse.com) Maison Tait House.

Have a great long weekend! Hope to see some of you at the [Fredericton Poutine Festival](http://frederictonpoutinefestival.weebly.com/) on Sunday, drinking local craft beer!
