Happy Friday, everyone! Our thoughts are now turning to summer, now that patios and outside dining can finally be enjoyed without having to wear our snowsuits! Grab a pint, and let's talk beer!

• The [13th Canadian Brewing Awards Gala](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) was held in Niagara Falls, Ontario, on Saturday night. Of the 125 medal-winning beers and ciders, a handful were from our region: [Bulwark](http://www.bulwarkcider.com/)'s _Gold Cider_ took home **Gold** in Specialty Cider,  [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) took home **Bronze** in Barley Wine for their _Ol' Fog Burner_, [Moosehead](http://moosehead.ca/home/) earned **Gold** in North American Style Blonde/Golden Ale with their _Pale Ale_, [Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/)'s _La Kedgwick_ earned a **Bronze** in European Style Lager (Pilsner), [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) took home **Gold** in Brown Ale for their _Iron Bridge Brown_, [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/)'s _Fire Cider_ took home **Gold** in Cider with Herbs/Spices, and [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) took home **Bronze** in Kolsch for their _North Shore Lagered Ale_. The Beer of the Year was _Scona Gold Kolsch_ from [Alley Kat](http://www.alleykatbeer.com/) in Edmonton, and [Four Winds Brewing](http://www.fourwindsbrewing.ca/) in Delta, BC, took home Top Brewery honours. Congratulations to all of the entrants and winners!

• It's almost summer, which means that the [Fredericton Beer Run](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonBeerRun?fref=ts) is just around the corner! This is the third year for the annual event, and with more runners - and more beer! - it should be the best one yet. Held on Monday, August 3rd (New Brunswick Day), runners can choose to participate in one of three distances - 4, 6 or 12 km - starting at the [Delta Fredericton](https://www.deltahotels.com/Hotels/Delta-Fredericton) at 10 am (all running tickets are $60 + fee). After your run, the sampling will begin! Every runner get 14 tickets, each of which is good for a 4 oz pour (runners will receive a custom-designed beer glass) from a selection of at least 30 beers, ciders, and meads in air-conditioned comfort back at the Delta. The brewery list has almost been finalized; expect to see around 15 breweries, most of which will be from New Brunswick. After the sampling is concluded, a bus will bring runners to the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) for an after-party, where there will be drink and food specials on for the rest of the afternoon. And if you're not into the actual "running" of this event, there are Coach's Tickets available for $42 + fee, which allows you to cheer on your runner, and still sample all of the beer (note that you must attend with a runner)! The event is already over 50% sold (this year's run will allow for up to 600 attendees), so don't wait much longer! Tickets can be purchased [online](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/fredericton-beer-run-2015-tickets-14099759761).

• [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) has re-released a favourite limited-release beer from last year, with a bit of a twist. _Vic Park Pale Ale_ is an APA with a grist made up of 50% 2-row and 50% Vienna malt; last year's batch featured late hop additions of **Citra** and **Kohatu** hops, which resulted in a very fruity and tropical beer. This year, they're using this beer in a single-hop series: every 2 weeks, the beer will be released featuring a different hop variety. This week's _Vic Park_ was hopped (and dry-hopped) heavily with **Citra**; varieties to follow will include **Nelson Sauvin**, **Galaxy** and **Waimea**, to mention a few. It weighs in at 45 IBUs and 5.7% ABV (brewer Chris Long has indicated that the ABV will likely decrease with the next batch), and is currently on tap at the brewery for growler fills and pints. You should also be able to find this series of beer on tap at [Gahan House - Charlottetown](http://charlottetown.gahan.ca/), [Fishbones](http://fishbones.ca/), and a few other select bars/restaurants.

• Tomorrow (June 13th) marks the opening day of the [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery) taproom in Nackawic, and you're invited to celebrate! Opening at 2 pm, there will be five Big Axe beers pouring (_The Hatchet_, _White Birch Porter_,_ Shakesbeer Chocolate Oatmeal Stout_, _Double Bit_, and their new, currently-unnamed English Pale Ale), along with a [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) cider and [Sunset Heights](https://www.facebook.com/SunsetHeightsMeadery) mead. Souther Ukrainian food will be available for purchase from 5-7 pm, and [Julio's Garage](https://www.facebook.com/JuliosGarageBand?fref=ts) will provide live music from 8-10 pm. Regular summer hours for the taproom will be Thursdays 12-7 pm, and Fri-Sat 12-9 pm.

• The [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/FoodatTheCrownDowntown) in Fredericton has started their new Happy Hour program, [Craft Beer at Twilight Happy Hour](https://www.facebook.com/events/468180093343742/). Featuring happy hour prices every night from 9-10 pm on a weekly-rotating New Brunswick craft brewery (subject to availability), it will continue for the duration of the summer (and hopefully beyond!). [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) is the first brewery currently featured, with [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) and Big Axe likely to follow.

• And speaking of the James Joyce/Food at the Crowne, as promised back in March, today marks the [opening](https://www.facebook.com/events/101088066900192/) of their craft beer garden/open air BBQ restaurant at the [Lighthouse on the Green](https://www.facebook.com/FredLighthouse) in downtown Fredericton. Various barbecued fare will be available, and there will be three taps pouring at all times - two Picaroons beers, with a third tap rotating through different New Brunswick breweries (TrailWay will be featured first). Hours are 11 am - 10 pm; Fri-Sun only for the first two weeks, but daily after that for the entire summer!

• The official [website](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com/) for soon-to-open [Upstreet Craft Brewing](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) has launched! It's chock-full of information on their beers, tasting room, and more, so be sure to check it out. They also released the first 50 memberships to their [Mug Club](http://www.upstreetcraftbrewing.com/#!mugclub/c70a)... which quickly sold out. Sorry! No worries, they will be releasing more soon... add your name to the waiting list on the Mug Club link to be sure you get yours. Including your own handmade Upstreet mug (which resides at the brewery), bigger pours, discounts on growler-fills and merchandise, and invitations to member-exclusive events, it's well-worth the yearly $60 membership fee! Look for their beer release before the end of the month, and Grand Opening in early July.

• A new upcoming brewery in New Brunswick has revealed itself ever-so-subtly on Facebook this week: [Flying Boats Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710), located in Shediac, is currently going through the process of getting their license to brew beer. Details are slim for now, of course, but we've been in contact with the owner/brewer, and will have plenty of information for you in the near future!

• [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) in Florenceville-Bristol, NB has announced that they will soon be offering bottles of their beer for sale at the brewery. These will join their growlers already available for off-site consumption, and supplement the taps and other breweries' bottles available in their tap room. Shortly after the launch in their retail store, the two initial bottled offerings be will be available at a handful of ANBL locations in their region. They will be using the 500mL format.

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is releasing their country-wide collaboration early next week, simultaneously brewed (and also to be released) by [Phillips Brewing](https://phillipsbeer.com/home), [Flying Monkeys](http://www.theflyingmonkeys.ca/), and [Trou du Diable](http://troududiable.com/). _Coast to Coastless_ is a 7.6% ABV Imperial ESB, brewed with Pale Ale, Kiln Amber (similar to Biscuit) and Crystal malts, UK hops **Bramling Cross**, **Challenger **and **Admiral** to 50 IBUs. Good news, folks who attend their [Backlot Bash](http://halifax.strangertickets.com/events/23919556/the-backlot-bash) tomorrow will get a sneak peak at this new brew! Tickets are still available for the concert/celebration, with proceeds going to the [Ecology Action Centre](https://www.ecologyaction.ca/). For those unable to make it, look for it on sale at the brewery store Monday, and at the private stores shortly thereafter. And Garrison will also be launching their re-branded look tomorrow at the Bash, centering on their iconic cannon logo.

• Tickets for August 7&8's [Halifax Seaport Beerfest](http://seaportbeerfest.com/) are now on sale. The 9th Annual Fest will take place once again at the Cunard Centre on the Waterfront. Tickets are $45+fees and tax, available [online](http://seaportbeerfest.com/tickets), and at [Ticket Atlantic](http://www.ticketatlantic.com/en/home/events/halifaxseaportbeerfest/info.aspx) or [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/) locations (where you can save the fees). VIP options are available for each session as well, allowing festival goers some cool swag and access to the floor early and a Q&A panel with special guests. As in previous years, there will be a Friday evening session, and Saturday afternoon and evening sessions. 300 beers and ciders will be available for tasting (most of which are not normally available in NS), with an expanded Cask Pavillion, as well as Gluten-free and Ciders options. The ticket price includes drinks, and food will be available for purchase from [Bramoso Pizza](http://www.bramoso.com/), [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/halifax/) and [Waterfront Warehouse](http://www.waterfrontwarehouse.ca/), all under $5. We will share more details on the beers pouring when available.

• [Yellowbelly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St. John's has a new beer on tap today, _Black Gold_. This 4.5% ABV black ale is balanced with 40 IBUs of the **Brewer's Gold** hop (added during the boil as well as dry hopping early during fermentation, and later in cold conditioning). The colour for this brew comes from Midnight Wheat (at about 8% of the grain bill), which imparts the dark colour and chocolate character, without the astringency found in other roasted malts. The wheat also aids in great head retention, and gives a "puffed wheat" character. Grab it on tap beginning today, and pick up bottles at the store and NLC later next week.

• Speaking of Yellowbelly, they are looking for a Brewer and Apprentice in their brewhouse. These positions will be to assist Brewmaster Liam McKenna as they expand their offerings and distribution. The 10 hl brewhouse located in the heart of downtown (on the corner of George and Water Streets) brews for both onsite consumption as well as bottles in the NLC. While the Brewer position requires formal brewing training and/or experience, the apprentice job is the perfect position for those interested in the wonderful world of brewing! Interested candidates should send an email to [yellowbellybrewerjob@gmail.com](mailto:yellowbellybrewerjob@gmail.com) for more details and to submit a résumé.







• Congratulations to [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/), as they mark their first anniversary as a commercial brewery! Their Thursday evening growler delivery service continues to be popular with folks in Windsor and Falmouth, so be sure to sign up on their website. Keep up to date with their [Southfield Project](https://www.facebook.com/SouthfieldProject), where they will be brewing a beer from hops and malt, all harvested from one field, with the malt processed in their brewery.







• Today's the day! The [Stillwell Beergarden](http://www.barstillwell.com/) will open its sliding doors today, inviting residents and visitors alike to drink great local beer, cider, wine and hand-crafted lemonade right on the water. And they couldn't have picked a better day for it! Ten taps, local sausages and snacks, get on it! Keep an eye on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BarStillwell) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/BarStillwell) feeds for the opening time announcement.

Thanks for tuning in! Another few local beers are back on tap, including [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) _Blueberry Ale_ and [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/) _Hop Hash_. [Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/)'s award-winning _La Kedgwick_ should be available in bottles at ANBL stores by early July. And don't forget that there's still tickets left for Fredericton's [Canada Day Bash](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/canada-day-bash-tickets-17100311492)... lots of beer, food, and patriotism/fireworks!
