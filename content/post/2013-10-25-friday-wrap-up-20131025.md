It's the last Friday of the week, which means it's time for more Atlantic Canada Beer news!

• This Saturday, October 26th, the [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) is holding their [Oktoberfest](https://www.facebook.com/events/651531698201852/) celebration at their location in Charlottetown, from 1-6 pm. With no charge for admission, there will be live entertainment and lots of food and beer for purchase; they will also be providing tours of the brewery for half-price. In addition, they will be holding their 1st Annual Growler Challenge! For $10, entrants will have a growler filled with the beer of their choice. All contestants will then hold the full growler at arm's length, parallel to the ground; the person who holds out the longest without bending their arm wins a $100 gift card from the [Murphy Hospitality Group](http://dpminc.com/) (which can be used at the brewery). All contestants get to keep the growler afterwards, of course!

• Speaking of the PEI Brewing Co., it looks like their popular Lobster Ale from this summer is going to continue to be available through the coming months. While this Saison will still be found in bottles, it will likely start turning up on tap at the brewery and other restaurants/bars in the Maritimes. It's currently available at many [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) stores in New Brunswick as well.

• Tonight, [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) will be hosting a tap-takeover at [Wilser's Room](http://thecapitalcomplex.com/wilsers-room/) in downtown Fredericton. Starting at 5 pm, all twelve taps will be dedicated to Picaroons beers, including their latest seasonal release, Harvest Ale, as well as special releases Plaid to the Bone and 104th Regiment. Live music by [Nick Ferrio](https://www.facebook.com/ferrioinstereo) starts at 9 pm.

• And while we're on the subject of Picaroons, they'll be releasing their very popular Winter Warmer seasonal on November 1st. Based on the English Barleywine style, it clocks in at 7.3% ABV. No events are planned for the official release as of yet; follow them on Facebook and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/picaroons) to stay updated!

• If you missed [Big Tide Brewing](http://www.bigtidebrew.com/)'s Pumpkin Ale brewed with fresh hops last month, good news! Brewer Wendy Papadopoulos has confirmed that a second batch has been brewed, again with locally-grown pumpkins that have been roasted in maple syrup and spices. While there were no more "fresh" hops left to use in the brewing process, Cascade and Hallertau hops were added to the boil; the 5% ABV beer also has cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander and ginger added in the brewing process. Get it at the brewpub (available on tap and for growler fills) before it's gone!

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) have released two fall favourites this week: their Martello Stout and Winter Warmer. With notes of chocolate and coffee, the Stout will be available for growler fills and bottles. The Winter Warmer, brewed with cinnamon and clove, and with notes of plums and dark fruit from the dark demerara sugar used, and a little more warming at 7.0% ABV, will be available in bottles only. Both are available now at the brewery, and bottles will be filtering out to the private stores shortly.


• [Sea Level](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) has released their fourth wet-hopped beer of the season, their Punkin' Grinner Ale. This is a new creation for brewmaster Randy Lawrence, clocking in at 5% ABV and amber in colour with a unique balance of spicy and sweet. It features all local ingredients with roasted [baby pam pie pumpkins](https://www.google.ca/search?q=baby+pam+pie+pumpkins&espv=210&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=ze5pUrXnM9D5kQenl4Fo&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&biw=1600&bih=721) from Sea Level's own gardens, honey from [Cosman & Whidden](http://www.novascotiahoney.com/) and Cascade hops grown on the Annapolis Valley floor. It is available now on tap at the [Port Pub](http://www.theportpub.com/) and in 1 Litre refillable growlers at Sea Level Brewing. Cans should be on their way to Halifax for this coming weekend, at [Harvest Wines and Spirits](https://www.facebook.com/harvestwines), [Cristall Wine Merchants](http://www.cristallwinemerchants.com/store/) and [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/). Also take note that this will be the last Sunday that the brewery will be open for the year, so take advantage of the nice fall weather and go for a drive to the Valley this weekend.


•[ Uncle Leo's Brewery](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/) and [Big Spruce Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) are both taking part in the [Swine & Stein](https://www.facebook.com/events/168718720000661/) event at [Pictou's Palace Theatre](https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=41+Water+Street,+Pictou,+NS&hl=en&sll=45.679332,-62.720603&sspn=0.039759,0.104628&oq=41+waterPictou,+NS&hnear=41+Water+St,+Pictou,+Nova+Scotia+B0K+1H0&t=m&z=16) this Saturday, 5-10pm. Your ticket ($15 in advance from Uncle Leo's or Stone Soup Cafe, $20 at the door) gets you inside for a massive pig roast and great entertainment from local artists. The beer is extra, but we know you won't mind paying for these two excellent breweries' beers.

• The [Hart & Thistle Gastropub](http://www.hartandthistle.com/) will be celebrating brewmaster [Greg Nash](https://twitter.com/__NASH__)'s 29th (again!) birthday in style tomorrow. Starting at 11am, they will be serving up a special burger, pork belly sliders and smoked brisket sandwiches. Oh, and beer too: the currently available Dank & Stormy DIPA, as well as a special 2012 keg of Commissar RIS. It will also mark the tapping of the 2013 edition of Hop Mess Monster, Nash's ode to hops. This year's beer clocks in at 11.5% ABV and 533 IBUs (calc), and features hops anywhere and everywhere throughout the brewing, fermenting and conditioning period. The ACBB will be in attendance, so come say hi!

• It looks like [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) has finally found a new location for their brewery! After plans fell through to open in Railcar 3 at the [Shogomoc site](http://www.florencevillebristol.ca/html/shogomoc.html), owner/brewer Mitch Biggar recently announced on his [Facebook site](https://www.facebook.com/groups/railcarbrewing/) that the brewery will be located in the rear unit at 9172 Main St. in Florenceville-Bristol. With 1800 square feet available, Mitch plans on opening the retail store and tasting area by the end of the year, with the brewery hopefully producing beer sometime in early 2014.

• [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) will be releasing their fall seasonal tomorrow, a Belgian IPA. The beer clocks in at 6.5% and 60 IBU, from the Centennial, Chinook and Brewers Gold hops. This is a very interesting style, with the spice and fruit character of the yeast blending very well with the hops. And don't forget that they've extended their hours: Open Monday to Thursday 12-7pm, and until 9pm Friday and Saturday, and open 12-6pm Sundays.

• If events in Charlottetown, Fredericton, Pictou, or Halifax aren't enough to satisfy you, don't forget about [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/)'s Grand Opening Saturday in [Shelburne](https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=78+OHIO+ROAD,+P.O.+BOX+1515+SHELBURNE,+NOVA+SCOTIA&hnear=78+Ohio+Rd,+Shelburne,+Nova+Scotia+B0T+1W0&gl=ca&t=m&z=16). There are still spots available on their free tours, and there will be lots of fun activities, food and beer to celebrate their opening. Check [last week's post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/friday-wrap-up-20131018/) for more details.

• [Premier Wine & Spirits](http://premierwines.ca/store/) in Halifax, purveyors of great beer, wine and spirits in Halifax, is looking for part-time clerk people. They are looking for folks to work 15-20 hours a week, and of course a knowledge (or love!) of beer and wine is a big plus. Drop off your resume at the store at 1535 Dresden Row between 10-8.

• The latest offering from the Newfoundland Artisanal and Craft Beer Club (aka [Beerthief](http://www.beerthief.ca/)) is closing this Sunday. The brewery being highlighted this go-around is [Muskoka Brewery](http://www.muskokabrewery.com/), after a very successful offering in the summer. Their Dark Ale, Craft Lager, Twice As Mad Tom IPA and Winter Jack (Tennessee whisky barrel-aged Double Chocolate Cranberry Stout) are all up for grabs. To sign up and/or put in a request, contact [Tom Beckett](mailto:tom.beckett@nl.rogers.com).

• Late addition to Friday Wrap-up: A reminder that [signup](http://nbcba.org/challenge/) to the Picaroons and [New Brunswick Craft Brewers Association](http://nbcba.org/forum/) Homebrew Challenge is due November 1st. Beers can be dropped off Nov 1-15 at the Picaroons Brewtique on Queen Street. More info is available in our [previous post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/friday-wrap-up-20130830/). Good luck to all NB Homebrewers!

Another week with lots going on! Have a good weekend...
