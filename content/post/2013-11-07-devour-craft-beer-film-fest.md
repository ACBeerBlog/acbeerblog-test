[Paddys Irish Brewpub](http://paddyspub.ca/) in Wolfville is hosting the [Devour Craft Beer Film Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/623879674324861/), November 13-17. Over the course of five days, they will be showing three great beer films at the Brewpub. I spoke with General Manager John Fitzgerald about the Festival, and what attendees can expect.

_**ACBB:** Please tell us about the films being screened at the Devour Craft Beer Film Festival._

**John:** The three films are: How Beer Saved the World, The American Brew and American Beer, and all three will play during every screening.

[How Beer Saved the World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV36ytSgC3o) - This show traces the important role that beer has played in human history from the probable origins of the first beer at the dawn of history to the development of a special beer for use in zero gravity space missions.

[The American Brew](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8BS0fef5w0) - American Brew is a celebration of beer culture and history in North America. From European immigrants bringing brewers over with early settlers, through the prohibition and up to the sophisticated micro brewing industries of today, it's enlightening, fun and goes well with a warm flagon of your local mash. Not likely to turn your Chardonnay sipping mother-in-law into a growler guzzling curmudgeon, but just about as interesting as it can get for us, the converted masses. Sit back, feet up and get educated on the cold stuff.

[American Beer: a bockumentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9dVo-MRckI) - This movie is half roadtrip, half educationally hilarious jaunt through 38 of America's craft breweries with five friends on a mission. That mission is to learn about beer, the craft brewing industry, and what makes it tick. Along the way they are educated and of course run into several mishaps. The film is a true testament to the American Craft brewing industry and the struggles that all the brewers and breweries go up against trying to educate the public and fight corporate America for their piece of the pie.

_**ACBB:** How much is admission to the Festival?_

**John:** Tickets to each screening are $10+HST, and are available at the Brewpub. That price includes a pint of beer, finger food buffet, a tour of the brewery, and of course the film! More drinks and food from the kitchen will be available during the screenings.

_**ACBB:** When and where will the films be shown?_

**John:** Showtimes are Wednesday Nov 13 and Thursday Nov 14 @ 6pm, Friday Nov 15 @ 9pm, Saturday Nov 16 @ 1pm and 9pm, and Sunday Nov 17 @ 1pm. The films will be shown in the Brewer's Room on the second floor of the Brewpub. The Brewpub and kitchen will be open throughout, for those not attending the screenings.
