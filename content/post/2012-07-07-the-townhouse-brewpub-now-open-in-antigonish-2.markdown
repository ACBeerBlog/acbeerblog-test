[Yesterday's Chronicle Herald](http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/114073-the-community-that-invests-together-drinks-together) included the story of a new brewpub, the Townhouse, that has opened up in Antigonish.  The article describes how owners Rose Murphy and Terry Piercey took creative approaches to raise money to start the business and also references the great community support they have received  and the help Kevin Keefe of Granite Brewery has provided.

The new brewpub [has a blog](http://antigonishtownhouse.blogspot.ca/) that includes information related to their unique [SUDS Club](http://antigonishtownhouse.blogspot.ca/p/join-suds-club.html) and a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/AntigonishTownhouse).  I haven't been able to track down any specifics related to the beers that are offered by the latest addition to the Atlantic brewing scene but will post more information as it is available.

Special thanks to [@**cmallaley**](https://twitter.com/cmallaley) for sending me a link to the story on Twitter.
