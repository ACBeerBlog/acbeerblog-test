Good morning, beer fans! As August begins (try hard not to think about summer ending), it's time for more local beer news...

• [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has released a new beer - [_Sessionista_](http://www.boxingrock.ca/blog/sessionista), a "Bold Session Ale". Brewed to be available as an easy-drinking summer beer (and at 3.5% ABV, it certainly is very sessionable), it has a heavy malt aroma "reminiscent of an English Bitter" with hints of lemon blossom and orange, according to the brewery, along with "roasty malt notes on the palate followed by a pithy lemon-lime finish". This is a limited-release beer, so pick some up while you can. It's available in 650 mL bottles at private liquor stores in Halifax, in one-litre growlers every Saturday at the [Halifax Seaport Market](http://www.halifaxfarmersmarket.com/) and the [Shelburne Farmers' Market](https://www.facebook.com/ShelburneFarmersMarket), and at the brewery, while supplies last. Look for it on tap at select beer bars in Halifax, as well.

• This weekend (August 1st-3rd), the 9th annual [Sappyfest](http://www.sappyfest.com/) (an independent music festival) is being held in Sackville, and [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) has brewed up a special beer for the event. Currently going by _Secret Show Ale_, this 4.5% ABV, 20 IBUs beer will be served during the festival on tap in the main tent, and afterwards should be available at both [Ducky's](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar) and [Thunder & Lightning](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Thunder-Lightning-Ltd/284755700327). With a malt base of Pilsner and a little wheat malt for head retention, it's hopped with Tettnanger and Saaz, and brewed "in a Kolsch frame of mind", according to brewmaster Andrew Estabrooks; that is, fermented cool to minimize production of fruity esters and diacetyl.

• There's a new beer on tap at the [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) brewpub, their _Raspberry Wheat_. A great style for the warm weather of summer, the brewery describes the beer as a German style wheat beer, "bombarded" with 40 kg of raspberries. "Tart and refreshing", it comes in at 5.5% ABV. It won't last long, so get down to the brewpub (and select restaurants/bars around Moncton) for a taste.

• [Big Tide Brewing](http://bigtidebrew.com/) is celebrating their 5th Anniversary on August 5th, and they've brewed up a special beer to celebrate! _Anniversary Amber Ale_ is a "malty, full-bodied ale" that is brewed with five varieties of specialty malts and five hop varieties (Willamette, EKG, Nugget, Fuggles, and Cascade), and will clock in at 55 IBUs and, yes, 5.5% ABV. Unfortunately, we weren't able to determine what else Big Tide has in store for their anniversary plans on the 5th, but keep an eye on their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co/301456876447) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bigtidebrewing) accounts for updates.

• The [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) is looking to release a new beer, a currently-unnamed Coffee Stout. They've brewed two different versions, and need your help in picking out which one is best! Drop into the brewery in Charlottetown, purchase a sample of each, and fill out a ballot indicating your choice for your favorite. Not only will you be helping the brewery decide which beer to brew on a larger scale, but you'll also be entered to win two VIP tickets to this year's [PEI Beer Festival](https://www.facebook.com/PEIbeerfest) (Sept. 5th & 6th).

• It looks like last Saturday's grand-opening for [Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) in Edmundston was a great success, and we now have a little more info on their [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301) collaboration beer that we mentioned [last week](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/friday-wrap-up-20140725/). As previously noted, the beer brewed is from the recipe for Acadie-Broue's Belgian Saison, _Tintamarre_. However, with this batch (brewed on a much larger scale on Petit-Sault's system), Acadie-Broue owner/brewer Patrice Godin has dry-hopped the beer with 5 kg of Amarillo and Simcoe. Along with Amarillo in the whirlpool addition, and the Belgian yeast strain used for fermentation, this should be a very fragrant beer! Due to the slight changes, this batch will be named _L'effrayab' Tintamarre_; "L'effrayab" is a local Madawaska county expression that translates to "incredible". With an ABV of ~6-6.5% and 36 IBUs, it should be ready in time for [National Acadian Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Acadian_Day) on August 15th; it will be packaged in kegs only, so look for it at bars/restaurants in the area. We'll keep you updated as to where exactly it will be served.

• The new beer news rolls on, with [Rudder's Brewpub](http://www.ruddersbrewpub.com/) announcing that they've recently tapped _Midnight Crossing Brown Ale_. Brewed with Pale Ale malt as the base, along with wheat malt and two other specialty malts, it is hopped with two English varieties and one from New Zealand. Clocking in at 6% ABV and 26 IBUs, it pours with a tan head and a dark brown color in the body, and has "smooth drinking with a slight bitterness in the finish", according to brewmaster Mike Ferguson.

• [A few weeks ago](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/07/11/friday-wrap-up-20140711/), we reported on a new beer from [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery), a California Common named _Gammie_. Well, that beer is now available! A well-balanced and easy-drinking beer at 5.3% ABV and 37 IBUs, you should be able to find it on tap now at [Shiretown Publicans](https://www.facebook.com/ShiretownPublicans) and [The Barrel's Head](http://www.thebarrelshead.com/); it may follow at Hammond River's other accounts in the near future.

• [The Antigonish Townhouse](http://antigonishtownhouse.wordpress.com/) is starting something new today... IPA Cask Night! Their first cask ever -_ Terry's British IPA_ - should be tapped at 5 pm, to coincide with the birthday of one of their favorite regular customers. More one-off casks will follow over the coming weeks, to allow the staff to get the whole process down; they hope for it to become a regular bi-weekly event after that. This will give brewer Terry Piercey the freedom to do a bit more experimenting for future brews.

• The [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) put together a great-looking event that's being held during Halifax's [Local Connections Sausage Fest](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/408/sausage-fest-2014) (Aug. 14th - 24th). Unfortunately, it's already sold out! Dubbed the [LBL Roof-top Cask Party at Scanway](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ladies-beer-league-roof-top-cask-party-at-scanway-tickets-12385430155), there will be three casks tapped: Propeller _Pilsner_, Garrison _Honey Lavendar_, and Boxing Rock _Hunky Dory Ginger_; special sausage morsels from Scanway will also be available. Tickets were $10, and include a take-home glass and first fill (pay-as-you-go afterwards). Looks like the LBL will have to start holding more beer events so everyone can attend!

• And in other Sausage Fest news, both [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) and [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) are participating in a [Sausage Brunch and Beer Brunch](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/458/sausage-brunch-and-beer-brunch) at [harbourstone sea grill & pour house](http://www.marriott.com/hotel-restaurants/yhzmc-halifax-marriott-harbourfront-hotel/harbourstone/5470933/home-page.mi) on Sunday, August 17th. From 10 am - 3 pm, there will be a variety of handcrafted sausages available, along with several beers from both breweries; tickets are $39.

• The 8th Annual [Halifax Seaport Beerfest](http://seaportbeerfest.com/) is almost here! It will be held August 8th - 9th at the Cunard Centre, and tickets are still available. While we plan on providing all the information you need sometime next week, we wanted to point out that the [full brewery/beer list](http://seaportbeerfest.com/breweries) has been posted on their website. With over 110 breweries pouring about 275 different beers and ciders - including an additional 15 unique casks from eight Atlantic Canadian breweries - it's shaping up to be another great beer festival for our region. Tune in next week for more details!

• [Duo Wine Bar](http://www.tideandboar.com/duo) is holding a patio beer dinner on Wednesday, August 6th (rain date August 13th) at 6:30 pm. There will be five courses and eight different beers being served, with several beers from American breweries [Goose Island](http://www.gooseisland.com/) and [Brooklyn Brewery](http://brooklynbrewery.com/verify). More importantly, one of the courses will feature a special release of [Celtic Knot](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) _Hopicide_ that has been "additionally hopped", paired with traditional German Curry Wurst. Tickets are $120 (tax and gratuity included); send them an [email](mailto:duo<at>tideandboar.com) to reserve yours.

• Looking for a job in the beer business? Well, with their expansion in progress, [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is [hiring](http://garrisonbrewing.com/accounts/garrison/websites/garrisonbrewing.com/website_files/files/Marketing%20Retail%20%20Event%20Coordinator%20Ad(4).pdf)... specifically, for the position of Marketing, Retail & Event Coordinator. Two to three years experience in marketing, retail, events, etc. is required; if you're interested, send a cover letter, resume, and references to [Tracy Phillipi](mailto:marketing<at>garrisonbrewing.com).

• This year's annual [Fredericton Beer Run](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonBeerRun?ref=br_tf), being held this Monday, August 4th (New Brunswick Day), has sold out! We've talked about the event in [previous posts](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/friday-wrap-up-20140606/), but to re-hash, it involves a 6 km or 12 km run, followed by beer sampling at the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/), where participants will be able to try fourteen 4 oz samples of various beers from local breweries. Check out their [Race Roster page](https://raceroster.com/events/2014/2796/fredericton-beer-run) for a list of participating breweries ([Railcar](http://railcarbrewing.com/) will not be pouring, but they will be present and selling beer swag).

• And speaking of the Fredericton Beer Run, the brain behind this event belongs to Lloyd Chambers, who also runs the yearly [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonCraftBeerFestival). Lloyd has confirmed that planning for next year's FCBF has already begun; while March 7th, 2015 is still many months away, we can assure you that there's already something new and special in mind! Looking forward to sharing more as the date gets closer!
