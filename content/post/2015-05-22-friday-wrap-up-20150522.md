Howdy! Now that we've all had a chance to recover from last week's excellent Nova Scotia Craft Beer Week... it's time to dive into more beer news! Hair of the dog, right?

• Following up on last week's news, we now have all the information on the third beer from [Upstreet Craft Brewing](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com). Joining _Commons Pilsner_ and _Do-Gooder APA _as the inaugural-release beers, _Rhuby Social_ is definitely a new style to the Island - a Strawberry-Rhubarb Witbier. Brewed with a simple malt bill and lightly hopped to 12 IBUs, it features several "traditional and non-traditional" spice additions at the end of the boil. It's then fermented with a "subtly-flavoured" Belgian yeast, adding character while allowing the Maritime-sourced rhubarb and strawberries (which are added post-fermentation) to shine through. This all results in a tart (but not sour), refreshing, and easy-drinking (at 5% ABV) ale. Looking forward to when all of us can sample these beers for the first time!

• [Celtic Knot](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) has recently rebrewed _For Shore_, their popular seasonal from last year. A Session IPA, this year's batch features some slight changes: where the first version of this beer was hopped with two Australian varieties, **Ella** and **Waimea**, the new batch will feature Ella and two other varieties, **Galaxy** (Australia) and **Mandarina Bavaria **(Germany)**,** both of which are known for being highly tropical and citrusy. Most of the hop additions came during the end of the boil and in the dry-hop, to maximize flavour and aroma while minimizing perceived bitterness. Coming in at 5% ABV and 35 IBUs, it should be available sometime in June; we'll keep you updated on its release!

• [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) has released their first Blonde Ale, named _Jilted Blonde_. Weighing in at 5% ABV and 30 IBUs, this beer features the Australian **Topaz** hop exclusively. A renowned multi-purpose hop, with excellent bittering, flavour and aroma properties, Brewmaster Jeremy White decided to only use it in the later stages of the boil. The result is a great example of the hop's characteristics. For an additional blast of Topaz aroma, a portion has been cask conditioned with a extra dry-hop charge, and will be available at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) soon.

• This year's Fredericton Burger Battle (organized by [Eat New Brunswick](https://www.facebook.com/thefrederictonburgerbattle?fref=ts)) is quickly approaching (June 8th-21st), and to coincide, [New Brunswick Beer Tours](https://www.facebook.com/newbrunswickbeertours?fref=ts) will be launching the first ever **YFC Burger Battle Walking Tours**. A series of four, 3-hour walking tours, each will feature six different sliders paired with a different [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) beer (8 oz per pour), at a different location (the key word here is "different"). Confirmed spots include the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/), [Brewbakers](https://www.facebook.com/brewbakersnb?fref=ts), [Vault 29](https://www.facebook.com/vault29nb?fref=ts), [The Blue Door](https://www.facebook.com/TheBlueDoorFredericton?fref=ts), and [Delta Fredericton](https://www.facebook.com/deltafre?fref=ts). The type of sliders available will change from tour to tour (there are four dates, June 11th, 13th, 18th and 20th), and will vary from beef tenderloin, to chorizo, to pulled pork, and beyond! Each Thursday tour will start at 6 pm, while the Saturday tours begin at 1 pm; tickets can be purchased for $49 (all included) on the NB Beer Tour site now. Exercise, beer, and burgers... the perfect combination!

• Speaking of Picaroons, it's been announced that they will eventually be opening a Brewtique-like location in Uptown Saint John, at [30-38 Canterbury St](https://goo.gl/maps/TybPV). Details are slim at the moment, but it is confirmed they will be occupying space at this address sometime in the future, where locals can expect to see several taps for growler fills, merchandise for sale, and a small brew system on-site. It's also possible they will dedicate some taps to local, small breweries in the future. Stay tuned!

• [YellowBelly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St. John's has released a summer seasonal this week, dubbed _Summer Wheat_. It is a light American Wheat Ale, brewed with 30% wheat malt, with the remainder of the grain bill being Canadian and English Pale Ale malts (2-row and Maris Otter). It is very light in appearance and slightly hazy due to the wheat content. It weighs in at 4.5% ABV, and is lightly bittered to 14 IBUs with **Nugget** and **Cluster**. It is also triple dry-hopped with **Cascade**, **Topaz** and **Mosaic**, for a substantial fruity aroma. From Brewmaster Liam McKenna, "I was worried it may turn into a sort of hop tea but the hop flavours have integrated well. It works perfectly as a taste of summer. It is light and hoppy but finishes extremely clean. A perfect patio beer." Cheers to that! It is on tap at the brewery now, but won't last long!

• There was some action at [Paddys Irish Brewpub](http://www.paddyspub.ca/) in Wolfville this week, as they took delivery of a new 7 BBL fermenter from [DME](http://www.dmebrewing.ca/). The expanded capacity will allow them to increase their draught and growler line-up to eight varieties, and to make lagers a regular part of their offerings. Speaking of which, look for their _Helles_ lager on tap shortly.

• The very popular _Cerberus IPA_ conspiracy brew between Big Spruce, [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) and [Tatamagouche](http://tatabrew.com/) breweries will make another appearance in bottles this morning, with a limited run available at [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/). It has also been available on tap for growler fills at all three breweries (and occasionally at the growler stations at the private stores), and their stocks are getting low, so be sure and snag this one today!

• The [Obey Convention VIII](http:///www.obeyconvention.com) has kicked off in Halifax, and to celebrate, [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has brought back _OBEY This Brew_. Available in bottles now, and on tap shortly at the brewery for samples and growlers, this 5% ABV & 40 IBU Pale Ale will also be available at all of the OBEY shows (licensing permitting).

• As part of next weekend's [Atlantic Beer Festival](http://www.atlanticbeerfestival.ca/), several spots in Moncton will be taking part in "Belgian Beer Week", kicking off Sunday. Daily dinners and Belgian beer tastings at the [Pump House Brewpub](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/), [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/), [St James Gate](http://www.st.jamesgate.ca/moncton/) and [Plan B](http://planbmoncton.com/) will feature different beers and breweries. Check the Festival's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/atlanticbeerfest/photos/a.402354903239336.1073741831.402272996580860/551555538319271/) for exact details. Tickets are still [available online](https://tickets.moncton.ca/Online/default.asp?brand=TradeShowsAndExhibits&sessionlanguage=EN) for all three sessions of the Fest.

• Tickets for the [NLC Beer Expo](http://www.nlliquor.com/Home/events/special-events/beer-expo-2015?view=full), being held June 5th and 6th at the [Delta St. John’s Hotel](https://www.deltahotels.com/Hotels/Delta-St.-John-s-Hotel-Conference-Centre), are on sale now. Priced at $82, they include unlimited tasting of more than 100 different beers and ciders (pamphlet with beer list is available [here](http://www.nlliquor.com/digital/books/beerexpo2015/)), pub grub, and a $10 taxi voucher. The show runs from 7-10 pm both Friday and Saturday, and tickets are available online [here](http://www.nlliquor.com/Home/events/special-events/beer-expo-2015?view=full).

• The [Gahan House Charlottetown](http://charlottetown.gahan.ca/) Homebrew Competition has been narrowed down to the final 6 entries, with the judging happening this weekend. Judging will also take place for the [Brewnosers Homebrew Competition](http://www.brewnosers.org/competition) this weekend. Good luck to all that entered!

As always, thanks for reading! The [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301)/[Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co/301456876447) collaboration beer, _[La Gaboteuse II](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/05/08/friday-wrap-up-20150508/)_, is now available at the Big Tide brewpub for pints and growlers; this Belgian IPA won't last long, so get down there quick to give it a try! This weekend, all four ANBL growler stations have a new version of Picaroons' _Blonde Ale_... this batch has been dry-hopped with lots of **Cascade**. They're calling it _Selection Blonde Ale_; you can also find a limited quantity at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf) for growler fills. Picaroons is also holding a [tap takeover](https://www.facebook.com/redherringpub) tomorrow, May 23rd, at the [Red Herring Pub](https://www.facebook.com/redherringpub) in Saint Andrews; there's no cover, and there should be lots of live music and beer! [Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/)'s IPA, _Soeur Catherine_, is back once again at the brewery for growler fills, and is expected to be available in bottles, soon. [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) is holding another Cask Night at the King Street Ale House this evening, starting at 5 pm; they'll have two casks pouring - their _Hugh John Hops_ (DIPA), and a new American Stout (which should follow soon after on tap around Fredericton). And finally, in other Fredericton news, rumours have been circulating for months about [Gray Stone Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gray-Stone-Brewing/1549204721960095?fref=ts), a brewery/taproom planning to open downtown (behind [Wilser's Room](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wilsers-Room/182990771717169?fref=ts)) in the near future. Recent artist renderings of the building have surfaced, and the city's planning advisory committee have approved zoning. We'll have more information on this new brewery for you, soon!
