Good morning! Yet another week full of beer news in Atlantic Canada...

• There's another new brewery gearing to start up in New Brunswick! Currently unnamed, the brewery's origins began in the [Grand Tracadie-Sheila](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Municipality_of_Grand_Tracadie%E2%80%93Sheila) area of the province; the brewery itself will be located somewhere in the Acadian peninsula. It will be owned under a joint co-op/private enterprise format, the first of its kind in the province. Money is being raised, boards are coming together, and they're looking for brewery equipment; the goal is to be brewing somewhere in the range of 5-10 bbl (155-310 U.S. gallons, or roughly 6-11 hL). We plan on having a standalone post on the brewery up soon; in the meantime, they're currently looking for more investors in the project. If you're interested, contact [Dean Roberts](mailto:dean.roberts<at>ipcsecurities.com) for more information.

• There's a new variation of one of the favorite beers from [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) out on tap - it's the _Back in Black Oatmeal Stout_, but brewed with some Smoked malt to give the beer a bit of smoke in the aroma and flavor. You can currently find it on tap at [Bourbon Quarter](http://www.bourbonquartersj.com/) in Saint John, [The Barrel's Head](http://www.thebarrelshead.com/) in Rothesay, and [540 Kitchen & Bar](https://www.facebook.com/540kitchenandbar) in Fredericton. And speaking of Fredericton, Hammond River beers are now available on tap at the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/); currently pouring is the award-winning American IPA, _Hop Flash_. And, stop by the ANBL in [Kennebecasis Valley](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=Kennebecasis+Valley) to grab a growler of the_ Gammie California Common_, tapped yesterday.

• [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) has tapped a pair of new beers this week. With the last drop of _Thulsa Doom II_ pouring this week, the _Insidious India Black Ale_ has made a triumphant return. Weighing in at 6.9% and 70 IBUs, this beer features 5.8 pounds of hops per barrel (!!), featuring **Columbus**, **Citra**, **Simcoe**, **Summit**, **Centennial**, and **German Magnum**, sure to keep the hop heads satisfied. _Restitution Porter_ is a brand new brew at the 'bottom this week, at 5.2% ABV, featuring some nice roast, chocolate and toffee and light caramel notes, and is lightly hopped to 30 IBUs with **Centennial** and **German Magnum** hops. A smaller batch, this special brew will only last a few weeks on tap. And be sure to drop by Wednesday afternoons for the latest firkin creation from Brewmaster Nash!

• [Celtic Knot Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) has just brewed a new beer, and it's a style that you don't usually see in our area: a [Scottish Heavy](http://bjcp.org/2008styles/style09.php#1b) (or 70/), a Scottish session beer that is amber-colored and normally malty with a dry finish, with an optional peaty or earthy character. Owner/brewer Bruce Barton has confirmed that his take on the beer (which he brewed for years as a homebrewer) is brewed with a Maris Otter malt base, several varieties of Crystal malt, and "a wee bit of Chocolate malt". Named _Caledonia_, the beer should come in at a very sessionable 3.8% ABV... it should be a great beer to drink several pints of! We'll let you know when it's available, which should be later this month.

• [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/) is releasing two new beers this weekend: _Operation Green Ring_ is a 5.0% ABV Cucumber Mint beer, brewed with two members of the [Brewnosers Homebrew Club](http://brewnosers.org/forums/), aka Delta Force Brewery. _Terroir_ is Bad Apple/Greg Nash collaboration Wet-hop beer, weighing in at 7.0% ABV, featuring well over 100 kilos of wet hops used throughout the brew (10 hl). Unique brewing practices have given this beer a very smooth and subtle, yet delicious hoppiness. Kegs will be delivered to [Tom's Little Havana](http://tomslittlehavana.wix.com/cafe) and [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) this weekend. It will also be available at the Brewhouse starting today for Growler fills. The _Black & Tackle Russian Imperial Stout_ is back on tap for a limited time, and they've filled two red wine barrels with the beer! Look for this unique combination around Christmas.

• [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) is once again aging some of their _Strong Dark Belgian_ in Glenora barrels. This beer was a big hit when it was first released; subsequent releases also sold out very quickly. Luckily for all of us, they've managed to get their hands on more barrels... four times as many! Look for the beer to be released in December, after an appropriate aging period.

• We have more details on the _Hants County Hops Series_ beers from [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/). All of the batches will feature Maritime Malt and English yeast, brewed using open primary fermenters. _Batch #1_ made its debut last weekend, and featured mostly **Golding**, with some **Cascade** hops. _Batch #2_ features mostly **Galena**, and will be released shortly. _Batch #3_ will feature **Zeus**, and _Batch #4_ features **Zeus** and **Galena**. Check out their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SHBPrincipal) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SchoohouseBrewery) pages for information on when/where to grab a pint, we understand that they will all be on tap at Bar Stillwell for an event early November. Also keep an eye out for growler sales in the near future.

• [Rudder's Brew Pub](http://www.ruddersbrewpub.com/) in Yarmouth is holding their 9th Annual Brewer's Dinner tonight. It will feature a four-course meal, prepared with some of their beer, and of course paired with beer to drink. The event kicks off at 7pm, and reservations are required (902-742-7311).

• [Paddys Irish Brewpub](http://www.paddyspub.ca/) has released their _Oktoberfest_ beer this week. Orange in colour with a medium body and balanced hop bitterness, it was brewed using German malt, hops and yeast. It weighs in at 7% ABV, and is very drinkable, thanks to a month of lagering. It is currently available on tap and in growlers in Wolfville, and will be on shortly at the Kentville location.

• [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released a favourite seasonal beer in the past week, the _Nocturne Dark Lager_. Weighing in at 4.8%, this Munich Style Dark Lager it is available now at both the Halifax and Dartmouth breweries, as well as the private stores. Rich and malty flavours are balanced with traditional German Noble hops to balance. It is brewed in support of [Nocturne: Art at Night](http://www.nocturnehalifax.ca/), taking place October 18th. This is a popular event, which sees the Halifax area turn into an indoor and outdoor art gallery for all styles. If you are interested in volunteering, please [check here](http://nocturnehalifax.ca/volunteers/) for more details.

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is releasing two beers this weekend: Their annual harvest beer, _3 Fields Harvest Ale_, is returning, featuring wet hops from Ross Farm, Meander River, and Fiddle Hop Farm. This beer weighs in at 6.3% ABV. They are also releasing a brand new beer, the _Double Jack Imperial Pumpkin,_ a 8.0% ABV darker brew featuring loads of local pumpkins. Both will be available at the brewery and private stores this weekend, and will be pouring at their stop at [City Harvest](http://www.ilovelocalhfx.ca/v1/) tomorrow.

•[ East Coast Beer Tours](http://eastcoastbeertours.com) has adjusted their Valley tour departing next Saturday, Oct 11th: they have downsized the bus slightly, and as such are able to pass along the savings to you! The price of a ticket is now only $50+HST, and still includes all of the great beer and food visits: [Meander River](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) in Ashdale, [Paddys Irish Brewpub](http://www.paddyspub.ca/) in Wolfville, and [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/) in Somerset. At each stop you'll be treated to a brewery tour and beer samples, and you'll also have some appetizers at Paddys and a BBQ featuring sausages from [Meadowbrook Meat Market](http://www.meadowbrookmeatmarket.com/) at Bad Apple. There will also be local musician CDs and other goodies given away during the trip. [Tickets are still available](http://eastcoastbeertours.com/products/annapolis-valley-tour), and you could win a pair of tickets by retweeting [this post](https://twitter.com/ECBeerTours/status/517526089019559937). Give the tour a try, we think you'll have a great time!

• [Rogues Roost](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) has released their _Oatmeal Stout_ this week. Available on tap and in growlers, it weighs in at 5.6% ABV and 40 IBUs, and features toasted oats, chocolate and dark crystal malt, and roasted barley.

• Following the release of the _Indian Beach Harvest Ale_ last week, [Big Tide](http://bigtidebrew.com/) has just released another fresh-hopped beer. _Indian Beach Pumpkin Ale_ was brewed with pumpkins grown at Fullerton Farms; they were hand-prepared and roasted for the brew. With a grist featuring Pale, Munich and Carared malts, it is hopped with fresh, local hops from [Dunhams Run](http://www.dunhamsrun.ca/), similar to the Harvest Ale. Clocking in at about 5.5% ABV, the beer also has cinnamon, orange peel, ginger, nutmeg, clove, molasses and local honey added for more flavor and aroma. It should be on tap at the brewpub now, and won't last long!

• [Gahan House Halifax](http://halifax.gahan.ca/) is putting the final touches on their _Peach Wit_ today, for release in the next couple of weeks. Two bushels of peaches from Elderkin's Farm in Wolfville are being peeled and pitted, and added to the conditioning tank today. To keep you satisfied until then, the _Pleasures and Treasures Maple Whiskey Porter_ and _Baby Steps Belgian Ale_ are still on, and tasting great! Be sure to drop by Tuesday night for their special casks. This week's will be a D_ouble Dry-hopped IPA_, so drop by and chat over a pint with Brewer Karen Allen. And don't forget that Tuesday is Industry night, where brewery and brewpub staff get a nice discount.

• Congratulations to [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) who were awarded an Impact Award from [Cape Breton Partnership](//www.capebretonpartnership.com), thanks to their significant impact on the local economy through improvements to local businesses! And speaking of Big Spruce, they are helping to organize the Celtic Oktoberfest, being held Oct 25th. In conjunction with the evening of fun, food and beer, there will be a [Pumpkin Launch](https://www.facebook.com/events/699336286807411/) at the Port Hawkesbury Marina. It's not too late to sign up your team's trebuchet or catapult to launch a pumpkin into the Strait!

• In large brewery news, [Moosehead](http://moosehead.ca/) has announced that they will be laying off about 70 workers - almost half of their hourly production employees - from their brewery in Saint John at the end of June, 2015. The brewery cites "the loss of a major brewing and packaging contract", according to a [recent story](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moosehead-to-lay-off-70-employees-at-saint-john-brewery-1.2785512?cmp=rss) from the CBC, as the reason for the lay-offs.
