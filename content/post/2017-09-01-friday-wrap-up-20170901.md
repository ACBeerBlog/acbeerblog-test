With September upon us, a reminder that grain and hop harvests have started around the region, which means it will only be a few weeks until those Wet-hopped beers will be available. With a vibrant hop farm scene here in the region, we expect to see Pale Ales and IPAs made with fresh hops in all four provinces. Until then, enjoy the rest of the new arrivals and returning favourites below...


• Speaking of the hop harvest, [Meander River Farm](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) is calling for all hands on deck **tomorrow morning at 9AM** to help pick their hops. Drop by the farm at [906 Woodville Rd in Ashdale](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Meander+River+Farm+%26+Brewery/@45.004638,-63.9275027,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4b59a07bb110fe73:0x2484ad150cc430b!2s906+Woodville+Rd,+Newport,+NS+B0N+2A0!3b1!8m2!3d45.004638!4d-63.925314!3m4!1s0x4b59a0795793dab3:0x71ffaa3260c0bfe1!8m2!3d45.0059684!4d-63.9255176) that morning to help out, and you may even earn yourself a sample or two!

• It's also a busy time for the folks at [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/), harvesting their own rye grain, grown adjacent to the Malt House and Taproom, which will be hitting the malt floor shortly. And we imagine the trucks filled with raw grain from other farms will be headed their way shortly! Luckily, they've released a new beer this week to keep the delivery folks happy. _PEI SMaSH_ is a 4.9% ABV Pale Ale, whose recipe features a Single Malt and Single Hop. The malt bill consists entirely of **Queens Two-Row Barley**, developed at Agriculture Canada's Charlottetown location in the 1990's. While not developed with malting as a priority (its higher beta glucan content undergoes the malting process a little slower than "malting grains"), but the grain thrives in our climate, making it a great choice for local farming. That slower malting process also allows Horton Ridge to take their time and work their magic. **Mandarina Bavaria** makes up the entire hop bill, which is used in moderation to balance the malt sweetness and add citrus aromatics, but as with all Horton Ridge beers, malt is the focus. The _PEI SMaSH_ is also a nice contrast to their _Rye's Up _Pale Ale, which features a mixed grist of 50% PEI Barley, with 25 % PEI Wheat, and 25% Rye (grown at the Malt house), showcasing the flavour profile from this special malt. As with all of the HR beers, the best place to enjoy them is at their Hortonville taproom, whose patio is still open, and you may be able to catch them harvesting the grain this weekend.

• Summer may be just about over, but it's not too late to report on one of the latest beers from [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/), _Sin Bin_. A Witbier brewed in collaboration with the PEI Mudmen, a local rugby team, the grist contains a majority of the very-light Heidelberg malt, along with small amounts of Malted and Torrified Wheat. Hopped to 15 IBUs with Tettnanger and Mt. Hood, the wort was spiced with Indian coriander seed and orange peel, in true Witbier fashion. Outside of the norm for the style, however, the beer was dry-hopped, on Day One of fermentation, with **another hop variety that they don't want to tell you about (hint: it was used due to its similar qualities to coriander)**. Dry and spicy, and coming in at 5.7% ABV, you can find it on tap at several PEIBC accounts in PEI, as well as at [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) in Dartmouth.

• Up on Agricola Street in Halifax’s North End, [Chain Yard Urban Cidery](https://www.chainyardcider.com/) released another new blend this week. Aptly called _Wild Flower_, it’s a blend of apple, fruit and flowers complemented by the use of wild yeast. Cider maker **Jay Hildybrant** started by making a wild blueberry wine, arresting the fermentation when it reached a point where spice notes were emerging and the berry flavour was “distant”. He also created a wild apple cider base using the same indigenous wild yeast and the juice blend from Chain Yard’s _Foundation_ (**McIntosh**, **Northern Spy** and **Jonagold**). From there, the cider was used to macerate lavender from Meander River Farms, just to the point before any soapy or off flavours were extracted. Lastly, the wine and the cider were blended to yield a “perfectly floral”, smooth, and easy-drinking cider that features spice and floral notes. It’s available for samples and pints at the cidery.

• There's a new easy-drinking beer from [Loyalist City](https://loyalistcitybrewing.ca) hitting tap accounts in Saint John and Fredericton... _Barefoot Blonde_ is a "New Zealand Blonde Ale" that takes your typical Blonde Ale a couple of steps further with the addition of fresh pineapple, as well as a dry-hop punch with **Nelson Sauvin**. A simple grist of 2-row and Wheat malt provides a light, sweet malt character, backing up the pineapple and grape notes from the fruit and hop additions. With a light bitterness to round off the finish, this 5% ABV brew should hit the spot during these last warm days of summer.

• Following the releases earlier this summer of their tasty fruited Berliner Weisse series, _Guava Heist_ (guava) and _Philaroma_ (cherry), [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) has another fruited Berliner available for your immediate enjoyment! _Rushton's Peach_ is another light (3.5% ABV), tart, kettle-soured brew, but this time it's been aged on 100 lbs of organic apricots and 300 lbs of peaches. Sound like another perfect beer for the end of summer? Even better news: like the previous two, it's available in cans, as well as growler fills and pints at the brewery, and at Tatabrew tap accounts.

• If you're feeling a bit overheated and need to get out of the sun, or just want to head downstairs for some beer and grub, the [Rockbottom](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) just tapped a new beer, _The Aristocrats_. A 100%-fermented Brett IPA, it combines the hop characteristics of "tropical fruit, hard candy and citrus" with the "pineapple, pear, wet hay, overripe berry, and an understated Brett funk" from the yeast. At 7% ABV and 60 IBUs, it's available now at the 'Bottom, while supplies last.

• If you missed it the first time around, _Grafted_, the orange peel-infused kettle sour from [Boxing Rock](https://boxingrock.ca/) is back. Created by **Brian Harvey**, this beer won the 2017 Boxing Rock Black Box Challenge. Thanks to some process tweaks at the brewery we’re promised a deeper sourness and more orange flavour in this batch, but otherwise it’s still a 5.5% ABV beer with low bitterness, a refreshing sourness and and sweet orange finish. This is a limited release of 650 mL bottles in the province, available at the brewery and making an appearance at the private liquor stores in Halifax. We’re told that later in September it will also make its way to Prince Edward Island via the [PEILCC](http://liquorpei.com/) so folks can get a taste outside Nova Scotia. In other Boxing Rock news, they’re rocking an all-new website, featuring a modern and responsive design, a list of their current beers, and online ordering for their swag shop and keg club. [Check it out](https://boxingrock.ca/)!

• Yarmouth's [Heritage Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/HeritageBrewingCo/) should be releasing _Strawberry Rhubarb Wheat_, their last summer seasonal for the year, sometime today. A light American Wheat Ale, it was fermented for two weeks before 45 lbs each of locally-harvested rhubarb and strawberries were added to secondary. Described by the brewery as being "light and refreshing, with a naturally tart flavour and a hint of sweetness", this 5% ABV brew will be available for growler fills and samples at the brewery only. Keep your eyes peeled for a slew of other new beers from Heritage in the near future, including a single-hop Session IPA featuring Experimental Hop #07270, a new IPA with **Chinook**, **Citra**, and **Ekuanot**, and a wet-hopped ale.

• Sit down, and prepare yourselves - [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) does NOT have a new beer release this week on the alpha brew side of things. No, no one is dead (that we know of), but don't worry, it sounds like there will be plenty coming through the pipeline next week! And there's still a new **Cask in the Sun** entry for today at 4 pm: _Damn Fine Coffee & Cherry Pie Pale Ale_ (damn, that's a lot of typing for a beer name) with [Low Point](https://www.facebook.com/lowpointcoffee/) cold brew, cherries, and "very, very toasted oats". And next Tuesday's **Beta Brewsday** is _Hard Corgi_ Black Lager (4.2% ABV, 34 IBUs), brewed by Drella Green-Simony and Johnny 'Burger' Heighton, with Kelly Costello. Fermented with California Lager yeast to keep it clean, it's a slightly-roasty beer hopped with **Cascade** and **Mosaic**.

• There has been a passing of the torch at [Mill Street St. John's](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) this week, with Head Brewer Dan heading off to the Toronto Mill Street location. In his place, Matt Chevrier has taken over the reigns. However, Dan's legacy lives on with a new release this week, _Tic-N-Tuff_ Hopfenweisse. At 6.0% ABV and 32 IBU, this hybrid German style features banana and clove from a Weisse, with a healthy dose of hops, in this case **Wild Turkey**, lending Passionfruit-like character. Grab a sample or pint today, and keep an eye out for its debut on the growler station this weekend.

• The [NSLC](https://www.mynslc.com) recently released their first quarter financial results for Fiscal Year 2018 and the results continue to be encouraging for fans of craft beer in the province. You might be aware that the quarter being reported here corresponds to the period starting this past April when the number of Nova Scotia Craft Beer listings at many NSLC stores jumped considerably. What impact did that have? Although overall beer sales were down 1.2% to $74.6 million and volume was down 2.7%, both significant declines over the same quarter last year, NS Craft Beer sales were up an impressive 48% to $3.2 million, a growth rate matching Q1 last year. Further, this implies that NS craft beer accounted for 4.3% of overall beer sales this quarter compared to 3.3% last year. After watching year-over-year quarterly growth decline over the course of FY 2017, it will be interesting to see whether that trend is mirrored this year or whether the wider selection will have a lingering impact. The news was also good for NS spirits and cider producers, with local spirits more than doubling sales over last year and the ready-to-drink category, which is mostly ciders when it comes to NS products, up 75.7%. Hopefully this continued growth will encourage the NSLC to continue the trend of adding SKUs and shelf space for local products, and maybe soon we’ll even see them supporting the smaller, non-bottling/non-canning producers through an in-store growler program.

• Attention AtlCan Brewers: the invitations for the [Atlantic Canadian Beer Awards](https://www.facebook.com/BeerAwardsAtlantic/) have gone out this week, so if you have not received them, let us know! Submissions are due in Halifax October 2nd-6th, with the judging taking place October 13-15th. The announcement and Gala is happening the next Sunday, **Octo****ber 22nd**, at the [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/).

• After a wildly successful Lambic-fest last weekend, the Stillwell crew are inviting the fine folks from [Oxbow](http://oxbowbeer.com/) in Newcastle, Maine to take over their taps next Friday and Saturday ([September 8 and 9](http://oxbowbeer.com/)). "Loud beer from a quiet place", Oxbow launched in 2011 and has been brewing farmhouse and eccentric beers in the woods of coastal Maine (and recently at their blending location in Portland) ever since. Featuring a full twelve-tap-takeover on Barrington on Friday, and ten taps at the Beer Garden Saturday, both locations will also receive a healthy number of Oxbow bottles to complement.

• Get ready, Charlottetown... [Unfiltered](http://hoppyasballs.ca) is coming your way! And not just a couple of beers, but the most Unfiltered beer that has ever hit PEI at one time. Starting **Thursday, September 14th**, Unfiltered will be taking over all 10 taps at [Hopyard](http://hopyard.ca/). And it's not just beer you'll be enjoying, head brewer Greg Nash has paired with HopYard master chef Jane Crawford to create a fully collaborative food menu, to go with all those tasty beverages.

At 5 PM the kids go home and the ticketed portion of the proceedings start. [For $16](http://www.tickethalifax.com/events/46956673/2017-garrison-oktoberfest) you’ll get your first beer (12oz) and entry to the rest of the evening’s proceedings, scheduled to go until 11 PM. There will be dancing, games, and food will be served throughout the evening. And of course, MOAR BEER. Proceeds from the event will benefit Cystic Fibrosis research and care through [CF Atlantic Canada](http://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/atlantic-canada/).

• The [James Joyce's](https://www.facebook.com/theJamesJoycePubFredericton/) first-ever sour beer tap takeover, Tarte Diem, was a huge success last weekend, with [Big Axe](http://www.bigaxe.ca/)'s _Seaberry Sour_ taking first place from the panel of three judges. Following up with second and third place were [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301)'s _Tête de Cochon Lichtenheiner_ and [Unfiltered](http://hoppyasballs.ca)'s _Daytimer_, respectively (and an honourable mention to [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com)'s _Island Hopspitality 2017_). If you missed out on the fun, don't worry... they've already set the date for next year's event, [Tarte Diem II - 2 Sour 2 Acidulous](https://www.facebook.com/events/113540102679304/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%223%22%2C%22ref_newsfeed_story_type%22%3A%22regular%22%2C%22feed_story_type%22%3A%22117%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22null%22%7D), on **Saturday, August 25th**.

**A few returning favourites, new releases, and casks to let you know before we sign off today**

- As we teased [last week](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/08/25/friday-wrap-up-for-august-25-2017/), [2 Crows](http://2crowsbrewing.com/) has a new beer dropping today at noon, _Promiseland_ Double IPA. This juicy, hop-forward beer, features **Citra** and **Simcoe** late in the boil, during active fermentation ([biotransformation](http://scottjanish.com/examination-of-studies-hopping-methods-and-concepts-for-achieving-maximum-hop-aroma-and-flavor/) for the win!) and during final conditioning. Grab the 8.3% ABV, 64 IBU, DIPA at 2 Crows today on tap (samples, pints, and growlers) and in cans, with cans also hitting the HRM private stores shortly.
- Lawrencetown's [Lunn's Mill Beer Co](https://lunnsmill.beer/) has dropped a new beer today, _Roadside Attraction_ Pale Ale. A 5.0% American Pale Ale featuring 100% **Cascade** hops, the lighter malt body lets the hop floral and citrus characters shine through, with medium bitterness. Grab it at their taproom today!
- Fredericton's [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) has released the latest in their **Pivot DIPA **Series, with _Pivot #6_. Keeping to the 8.0% / 80 IBU specs as previous releases, this version features **Mosaic** and **Warrior** hops for tropical and candy-like aromas. As with all of these releases, they can be found at their locations in Fredericton, Saint John, and St. Andrews, with delivery to the ANBL expected early next week.
- [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) has re-released their _Green Island_ American IPA (6% ABV), with some slight tweaks to the hop additions, resulting in strong pineapple flavours, according to the brewery; available on tap and in cans at the brewery.
- [Unfiltered](http://hoppyasballs.ca) releases their _Front Line Rocker_ DIPA (8% ABV) at Charm School today, for growlers and pints; look for it to pop up around the HRM on tap as well, and select establishments in PEI and NB.
- [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com)'s seasonal Pumpkin Ale (yes, it's that time again), _Gravedigger_ (6.5% ABV), drops today (bottles and kegs);
- At [Schoolhouse](http://schoolhousebrewery.ca/) in Windsor, NS, their **Cask Friday** beer this afternoon is their witbier, _Summer Break_, with blackberries and raspberries. Sounds like a lovely beer to sip on the first day of September.
- And not to be outdone on the cask front, Halifax’s [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) will have some of their _Organic Blonde Ale_ aged on the Japanese citrus fruit Yuzu on tap this evening at 5 PM. But wait, there’s more! Tomorrow at 2 PM they’re tapping a special 20 L keg of their _Cascade Pale Ale_ that will be dosed with fresh **Cascade** hops picked less than 24 hours before. You won’t find beer with fresher hops than that.
- And on the Rock, [Yellowbelly](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) has their _East Coast Cream Ale_, a collaboration with [Top Shed Brewery](http://topshed.com/) in Goonengerry, NSW, Australia, back on tap and available at the brewery in bottles as well. Limited bottles will also be going to the [NLC](http://nlliquor.com/) tomorrow. Kangamoose is on the loose!
