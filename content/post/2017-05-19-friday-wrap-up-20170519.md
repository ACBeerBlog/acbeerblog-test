Wow, look what happened over the last couple of days... spring/summer actually arrived! Better late than never, right? We're sure the sunny rays have helped those of you who were lucky enough to indulge in Nova Scotia Craft Beer Week recover, so it's now time to dive right in to the usual geyser of beer news that's been going on over the past week...

• The [YellowBelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) has a new beer on tap, released late last week in conjunction with the [NLC's Beer Expo](http://www.nlcevents.com/beer-expo) which took place over the weekend. _Ryan's Fancy IPA_ was brewed with 2-row, Munich and Carastan malts, and hopped with generous amounts of "an assortment of varietals", both in the kettle and dry-hop additions. Coming in at 6.3% ABV and 60 IBUs, it has a firm supporting malt backbone, and is described as "resinously bitter" by the brewery. It's on tap now at the brewpub.

• Mahone Bay's [Saltbox Brewery](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) has one heck of a big beer out, brewed to recognize the traditions of Maritime sailors. _Fog Bank_ is a rich, chocolatey stout that was aged for five months in rum barrels. The result is an 11% ABV monster of a beer, with vanilla and dark fruit notes, and a deceptively "smooth, mellow finish"... that should become even smoother with some age. It's available at the brewery for 13 oz pours, and also in bottles, giving you the opportunity to pick up a few; try one now, and throw a couple more in your cellar to try again in several months... or even longer!

• Apparently not tired out by NSCBW one bit, [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) is releasing a brand new beer, and a new iteration of another. Let's start with the new one, the first in their new SMaSH series (single-malt and single-hop), _SMaSH No. 1: Dr. Rudi_. Brewed with 2-row and the **Dr. Rudi** hop variety (yes, that's a thing), it was fermented with [White Labs East Coast Ale](http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-bank/wlp008-east-coast-ale-yeast) yeast. With aromas of "cantaloupe, citrus, honey, and pine", and fruity and herbal flavours, it weighs in at 6% ABV and 47 IBUs. Gluten-reduced like all GR beers, it will be available Monday-ish at GR's taproom, and will be popping up at fine tap accounts in the HRM.

• Moving along, today Good Robot is releasing **version 3.0** of their well-loved-but-difficult-to-type _Damn Fine Coffee and Cherry Pie Pale Ale_.  This take features Kenya Nyeri Mahiga coffee beans from [Java Blend](http://javablendcoffee.com/), cold-brewed by [Low Point Coffee Co.](https://www.facebook.com/lowpointcoffee/), giving the beer "notes of cocoa, citrus and stone fruit", according to the brewery. Aside from the coffee used, the rest of the brew is similar to previous releases; 5.5% ABV, 32 IBUs, also available at the brewery and at select tap accounts.

• The third and final beer in [Roof Hound](http://roofhound.ca/)'s Dive Bar Classic Cocktail Series is now available. _Harvey Wallbanger_ is an American Wheat Ale brewed with both Pilsner and Wheat malt, with orange and vanilla beans added during the brew process (juice at the end of the boil, and zest and vanilla bean in secondary) to give you the aromas and flavours normally associated with [the classic mixed drink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Wallbanger) (traditionally made with vodka, orange juice, and Galliano liqueur). Easy drinking at just 4.4% ABV and 16 IBUs, it's on tap now at the brewery; drop by tomorrow, and you can try it in a mini-flight of all three in the Cocktail Series - joining previous releases _Mojito Sour_ and _Fuzzy Navel IPA_ - for just $5.

• [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) hasn't been slowing down with their "small-batch" (read: 10 bbl) releases, as they've brought back _Ellipse_, a crowd-favourite 6.3% ABV American IPA that was originally released early this year. Inspired by the "intense orange-citrus character" from large additions of the very popular **Amarillo** hop variety, some **Columbus** was also thrown in to provide some "dankness and spiciness" to complement. Luckily, this batch is also available in cans, which can be picked up only at the brewery taproom (along with growlers) for the time-being. Drop by today for your hazy-and-juicy fix!

• In other Fredericton news, [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) is launching a new beer series today, showcasing a brew with a static grain bill but ever-changing hop profile. _Pivot_ is an Imperial IPA that will feature a simple grist of Canadian 2-row and a touch of Toasted Wheat (to 8% ABV) that will allow the changing variety of hops to be front and center. Two batches have already been brewed: _Pivot #1_ will be released today on tap only, at all four Picaroons locations in NB, and was hopped with **Warrior**, **Azacca**, and **Hallertau Blanc**, giving notes of "melon, pineapple, bubblegum, and white grapes", according to the brewery; _Pivot #2_ will be released next week in bottles only, throughout the province. The #2 features **Warrior** and **Azacca only**, with a larger dry-hop addition this time around. For bottle purchases, look for the batch number on the side of the label; you can head to [this site](http://picaroons.ca/pivot/) to check out which hops were used in each batch.

• After an initial release at last weekend's Full House event for NSCBW, [Lunn's Mill](https://lunnsmill.beer/) is officially launching their latest American IPA, _Purple Grain_. A gold-coloured brew featuring a "balanced malt body with notes of honey", it was hopped with **Cascade**, **Centennial** and **Citra** for "tangy and slightly spicy" flavors.  This 5.5% ABV, Prince-themed beer is available for growler fills at the brewery, but only a small amount is left, so drop by during their [opening hours](https://www.lunnsmill.beer/pages/the-brewery) (or request a [growler delivery](https://www.lunnsmill.beer/pages/how-to-get-beer))!

• We’d love to tell you about the _Jade Moon_ APA from [Tidehouse](https://www.facebook.com/tidehousebrewingcompany/), but there’d be no point in that because it’s gone already, thanks to its presence at both last weekend’s Craft Beer Full House and the [Timeraiser](http://www.timeraiser.ca/) event at the [Halifax Central Library](http://halifaxcentrallibrary.ca/) this past Monday. While we wait to see whether that one makes a reappearance, however, the gang has two even newer beers for us this week. First we’ve got another in the APA style, _‘Insert Clever Name Here’_ Pale Ale, a 5.5% ABV beer with 56 or so IBU, 97% of which came from post-boil additions of pungent **Simcoe** and **Citra** hops. The grist sees 2-Row supplemented with Maris Otter and Munich, which should give it a solid malt base against which passionfruit, lemon zest and light pineapple notes will contrast. This one will be available for fills at the brewery this weekend and is also slated to be on tap at Halifax’s new noodle sensation, [Water & Bone](http://www.waterandbone.ca/), posthaste.

• Also debuting this weekend is the first in a new series of beers brewed by **Shannon Higgins** (née Rockwell), partner of Tidehouse principal Shean Higgins. _Rockwell Series vol. I_ is a truly big DIPA that comes in at 9%. It’s been heavily hopped (“to high heaven”) with modern American hop varieties **Simcoe**, **Amarillo**, **Mosaic**, and **Citra** giving notes of orange, mango and peaches. Shannon also tells us it has a creamy body and thirst-quenching dry finish and it’s the beer she “wants to drink”. We suspect she won’t be alone on that one. Look for it at the brewery today and Halifax Forum Farmers' Market tomorrow for fills for sure, and possibly on tap elsewhere, if we don't drink it all first.

• [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has hopped aboard the canning train after 20 years of their beers being available exclusively in bottle form (outside of kegs, of course!). One of their first beers, _Tall Ship_, is available now in 473 mL cans, with several more brands - including _Seaport Blonde_  available this weekend, and _Juicy! DIPA_ following in the near future. Featuring new label designs, the NSLC and Halifax private stores will be the first to receive all three beers (outside of the brewery), but they will also be selling in NB and Newfoundland (and at least one brand in PEI, and parts West as well) by this summer. We asked Garrison man-about-town Jeff Green about the addition of cans to the Garrison brand, here's what he had to share: “The people have spoken. Cans, specifically the 473ml (16 oz.) cans continue to grow in popularity and we are pumped to finally be bringing something to the party. Cans allow us to offer some favourites like Tall Ship in a second format, move certain seasonals like Seaport Blonde into a better pack for and serve up some new beauties like Juicy! in a more portable, chillable, crushable (see what I did there) package. We also get to design some cool new labels and have fun with the huge array of textures and design highlights available from the great folks at [FastTrack Packaging](http://ftpackaging.ca/). After 20 years exclusively in bottle format, we are SUPER excited to see what the future holds with cans!”

• Garrison is also proud to release the first of two special releases to celebrate 20 years of brewing craft beer in Halifax. Launched yesterday at the brewery, _20th Anniversary Triple IPA_ is a hybrid beer, lying somewhere between an extra-strong Imperial IPA and an American Barleywine. It features a simple grain bill of 100% Maritime Pale Ale Malt, with **Glacier**, **Amarillo**, **Citra**, **El Dorado**, and **Crystal** hops in the boil and Crystal and **Centennial** for dry-hop. Cold conditioned for two full seasons, it weighs in at a hefty 9% and 100 IBU. Despite the very strong malt presence, it still manages to be hop-forward, with earthy, floral, fruity hop flavors, fruity yeast esters, and sweet malt notes, including caramel flavours developed during an extended boil. This beer is available now at the brewery in bottles and you’ll also be able to find it by next week at the private stores in Halifax and, eventually, in New Brunswick and Newfoundland.

• [Nine Locks](http://www.ninelocksbrewing.ca) will soon be releasing _Ginger Rye_, a full-bodied, red-colored ale. Brewed with an unspecified amount of Rye and Wheat malt, it features "subtle caramel malts, and a restrained ginger presence on the palate", according to the brewery. Finishing with some "assertive spiciness" thanks to the addition of real ginger in the brewing process, it clocks in at 5.6% ABV and 15 IBUs, and will be available soon at the brewery only, on tap. And keep your eyes on this space for upcoming details on their first SMaSH beer, brewed earlier this week.

• Rothesay's [Foghorn](http://www.drinkfoghorn.ca/) has re-released _The Yellow Dart_, a beer we haven't seen since the brewery originally launched last fall. This India Session Ale (aka Session IPA) has been tweaked slightly in the hop department, now including **Vic Secret**, **Columbus**, and **Huell Melon**, providing lots of tropical character in the aroma. Out just in time for the hot days we've finally been experiencing, it's the perfect summer slammer you've been waiting for. At 4.5% ABV and 35 IBUs, it's available now at the brewery taproom for pints and growlers; keep your eyes open on your favourite Foghorn tap accounts, as it may pop up there as well.

• Shelburne's [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has two new releases out now, and a special launch this weekend for one of them. _Dark as Keji _is the Black IPA we told you about [last month](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/04/21/friday-wrap-up-20170421/), and is now in wide release. The 6.5% ABV beer is available in sixpacks at the NSLC and private stores, and of course at the brewery in Shelburne. But what better way to enjoy it than under a dark sky in Keji itself? **Tomorrow evening** at the Sky Circle at [Kejimkujik National Park](http://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ns/kejimkujik), there will be samples of the beer available from 8PM, followed by a Dark Sky look at the stars at 9:30PM presented by Parks Canada, [Friends of Keji](http://www.friendsofkeji.ns.ca/), and the [Royal Astronomical Society of Canada](https://www.rasc.ca/). And for every sixpack of _Dark as Keji_ sold, Boxing Rock is donating 50 cents to FoK.

• Boxing Rock's second release this week is the winner of their Second Annual Black Box Challenge. Homebrewer Brian Harvey, who brews under the moniker [1029 Brewing](https://twitter.com/1029Brewing), had used the ingredients provided to put together _Grafted_, an Orange Peel Sour, which garnered solid marks from the judges, and took the top prize aided by his unique presentation. He visited the brewery in Shelburne last month to brew the full-sized batch, and it is now available to the rest of us. A sour mash was performed to get the beer started on the right foot, with orange peel used in both the mash and the boil for an extra citrus kick. The 5.5% ABV beer has been bottled, and is available now at the private stores in HRM, with growlers available at the Market and brewery. Grab one today to see what all the fuss is about!

• [Unfiltered](http://hoppyasballs.ca)'s popular SMaSH DIPA, _Double Orange Ale_ (7.5% ABV), featuring everyone's favourite hop, **Citra**, is back again starting today; drop by Charm School for a pint and/or growler fill.

• Released last night at the brewery in Rose Valley, [BarNone](http://barnone.beer/) has a brand new beer out, using all Island-grown barley. Grown by the Craig family in Tryon, it was malted by [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley, and sent back across the bridge for use. Hopped as a Pale Ale, the malt is the key in this 5.0% beer, with the subtle earthy character of the base malt shining through nicely, even giving a slight spice character. Grab _Try On_ next Growler Night at the brewery (Thursdays from 6), and look for it at BN's regular taps on the Island shortly.

• The [St. John's Beer Tours](http://www.stjohnsbeertours.com/) website went live on the weekend, and tickets are selling fast! The first tours of the season will be held Friday, June 2nd, and typically run in the afternoons of Thursday-Sunday each week throughout the summer. There are deep discounts for the first tours of the season, so be sure to snag one today. Depending on the tour type chosen (anything from _Axes & Ales_, _Scuff & Scoff_, _Ultimate Townie Brew Tour_, or _Hoppy Highlights_), participants visit different spots in St. John's and nearby Quidi Vidi. They are also holding a contest on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stjohnsbeertours/photos/a.1396914126998089.1073741828.1373835755972593/1499326953423472/?type=3&permPage=1), to win a day in the brewery with Mill Street St John's Head Brewer Dan Boldrini.

• [The PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) will be opening up a new location for pint purchases and growlers-to-go at the [PEI Factory Shops at Cows Creamery](http://peifactoryshops.com/). **The Beer Station** will basically act as an extended, miniature version of the brewery's taproom on Kensington Rd., with six taps available (featuring five PEIBC core beers, and one rotating seasonal), and a small retail section with various clothing products available for purchase. Customers can enjoy a pint on-site, as well as several food items from a limited menu, and can pick up a variety of cans and bottles (as well as growler fills) to take home. Look for the Beer Station to open by the end of this month.

• Earlier this year, [Central City Brewing](http://centralcitybrewing.com/) in Surrey, BC, brewed up a collaboration beer with a brewery from each province. Each of the 12 beers has been brewed at Central City’s Surrey brewery specially for this collaboration and embodies the region they represent. A brewer/representative from each collaborating brewery joined the Central City brewers to brew the recipe that they helped design. These have been trickling out to the stores in each province, either at the provincial stores, or private shops. Highlighting the beers produced with our local breweries, with the full list [available here](http://centralcitybrewing.com/celebrate-canada-150-with-the-red-racer-across-the-nation-collaboration-canada-150-mixed-pack-featuring-12-craft-breweries-from-across-the-nation/):  Picaroons collaborated on _Restored Hop(e) ESB_, inspired by the province's motto _Spem reduxit_, meaning "Hope is restored". Garrison came in with _"New" Scottish Ale_, a lightly peated Scottish Ale. PEI Brewing Company brought together local ingredients for _Bière d'ici Honey Ale_, using PEI honey and Maritimes-grown hops, a lighter take on the Bière de Garde style. Quidi Vidi Brewing Company went German for _Hop To The East Hefeweizen_, with new tropical-aromatic hops, for a unique twist on this classic style. To celebrate the releases, they will be holding tasting events at each of the participating breweries during the second week of June: Monday June 12th at Quidi Vidi, Thursday June 15th at PEI Brewing Company, Friday June 16th at Picaroons, and Saturday June 17th at Garrison. Look for more details on these events in the coming weeks. And look for the 12-pack of beer at your local [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/ProductDetails/28199) now, and coming some to the [PEILCC](http://liquorpei.com/) and [NLC](http://nlliquor.com). In Nova Scotia, while the NSLC will not be carrying it, [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) will have it for sale in June.

**Remember to check ahead if your local beer store or brewery is open for this long weekend. We suggest stocking up early and often, just to be sure...**
