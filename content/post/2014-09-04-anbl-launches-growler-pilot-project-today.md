The ANBL is launching its Growler Pilot Project today at three locations - [Prospect Street](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=Prospect+Street) (Fredericton), [Kennebecasis Valley](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=Kennebecasis+Valley) (near Saint John), and [Regis Street](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=Dieppe+Regis) (Dieppe) - when they open at 10:00 am.

Customers wishing to take part in the program must purchase an [ANBL-branded 1.89 litre growler](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anbl-growler.jpg) for $8; growler fills have four different prices ($8, $10, $12 and $15), depending on the beer chosen. The ANBL plans on rotating the selection on a regular basis; whether particular beers will be re-ordered will depend on sales. However, the Dieppe store will feature a permanent [Pump House tap](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/), while the Prospect St. store will have one tap dedicated to [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) beers.

The first beers that will be available in this program are as follows:

Prospect St.: Picaroons Selection DIPA, [Unibroue](http://www.unibroue.com/) Ephemere Cranberry, [Labatt](http://www.labatt.com/?language=en) Shock Top Belgian Wheat

Dieppe: Pump House IPA, [Flying Monkeys](http://www.theflyingmonkeys.ca/) Genius of Suburbia, [Creemore Springs](http://www.creemoresprings.com/en/Home.aspx) Premium Lager

Kennebecasis Valley: [Moosehead](http://moosehead.ca/) Boundary Ale, [McAuslan](http://mcauslan.com/en/) Pumpkin Ale, Flying Monkeys Hoptical Illusion

Though touted as a way to increase both a wider range of products and distribution for local and small craft breweries (it has been said that the program would "only be offering craft or import beers, [and not] mainstream domestic beers", according to ANBL CEO Brian Harriman), most of the initial beer offerings will be from outside of the region, and some from multi-national breweries. We reached out to the smaller NB producers not on the initial list, and they cited lack of details on pricing and volume requirements, as well as packaging concerns, for reasons not to take part in the launch. We hope that the ANBL and small breweries will be able to make the economics work to increase local participation in the project. You can do your part by requesting them at the ANBL.

If this initial pilot program is a success, the ANBL plans on increasing to 10-15 stores, "in a more permanent fashion".
