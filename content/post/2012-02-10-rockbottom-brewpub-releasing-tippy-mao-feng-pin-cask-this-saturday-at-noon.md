[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/rock_bottom1.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/rock_bottom1.jpg)What happens when you mix the world's second and third most popular beverages ([tea and beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer))?  Find out this Saturday as [Greg Nash's latest creation](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.com/2012/02/tippy-mao-feng-pin-cask-saturday-noon.html) dubbed Tippy Mao Feng Pin Cask is available at Rockbottom Brewpub.  They'll be cracking a pin (which is about 21 litres) of cask ale which is made up of their Deadwood Wheat beer infused with Yunnan Tippy Mao Feng Black Tea.
