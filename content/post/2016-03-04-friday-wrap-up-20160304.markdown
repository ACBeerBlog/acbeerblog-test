Happy Friday, beer fans! A brewery launch, plenty of beer launches and events, and the start of Fredericton Craft Beer Week. Let's go!

• [Nine Locks Brewing](http://www.ninelocksbrewing.ca) launched this week in Dartmouth. Located at [219 Waverley Rd](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/219+Waverley+Rd,+Dartmouth/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4b5a26a0baf23d57:0x81e1c9b5e8a8aa58?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6hNjZ66bLAhUEkIMKHZGqDsMQ8gEIGzAA), adjacent to the Mic Mac Tavern, they opened their doors Monday afternoon. They are currently selling two beers, an IPA, and an ESB. The _India Pale Ale _is 6.9% ABV and 70 IBUs, featuring loads of citrus and floral hop character and smooth bitterness, from first wort hopping, hop bursting (adding the majority of hops in the last 20min of the boil, retaining most of the aromatic oils), and dry hopping. The _Extra Special Bitter_ is 5.6% ABV and 35 IBUs, featuring English **East Kent Golding** and **Fuggles** hops for a subtle Noble hop spiciness. The beers are currently available in growlers to go at the brewery (both 1L flip-top and 1.89L), with canning beginning before the end of March. When that happens, look for cans at the private beer stores in HRM, as well as a selection of NSLCs around the province. Also look for the full release of their _Dirty Blonde_ and _Porter_ before the end of March. The storefront is open Mon-Fri 12-9pm, Sat 11-9pm, and Sun 12-5pm 12-9. Congratulations to the entire Nine Locks family!

• It's been a busy week at Halifax's [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/)! The Awards Gala for the _8th Annual Home Brew-Off_ were last night. The 45 entrants, plus family, friends, and members of the public, gathered at Garrison's tasting room to hear the results in the Experimental American IPA category. This year's winning beer was _Honey Chamomile_, brewed by **Mark Power**. Using honey malt to complement the chamomile herb, it featured nice hop additions to give it the necessary bitterness and aroma the judges were looking for. Rounding out the Final Four were a Toasted Coconut IPA, Earl Grey Tea IPA, and Parmesan & Jalepeno IPA. Congratulations!

• Attendees were able to taste the top 3 winners, as well as get the first pours of last year's winning beer, _Mr. Robusto_. Brewed by Dave Martin and the Garrison crew, this Robust Porter is 6.5% ABV and 33 IBUs. Notes of sweet chocolate are prominent, along with vanilla and caramel, but with enough hops to balance. _Mr. Robusto_ is available for purchase in bottles and growler fills at the brewery now, and will be available at the private beer stores and NSLCs shortly.

• Last night also served as the release party for the final beer in the **Cellar Series**, _To Prussia With Love._ This big beer is a blend of their _Grand Baltic Porter_, along with Barrel-Aged _Coast to Coastless _Imperial ESB (their collaboration with [Le Trou du Diable](http://troududiable.com/), [Flying Monkeys](http://www.flyingmonkeys.ca/), and [Phillips](https://phillipsbeer.com/)). The barrels were from [Ironworks Distillery](http://www.ironworksdistillery.com/) in Lunenburg, and had previously held rum. The beer weighs in at 10% ABV and 35 IBUs, and is available for purchase in bottles now at the brewery, as well as previous Cellar Series beers _Ol' Fog Burner_ and _Grand Baltic Porter_, the former being available at the private stores soon.

• Garrison Brewmaster Daniel Girard will be facing off against wine maker [Pete Luckett](http://luckettvineyards.com/) March 31st at the [Harbourstone Sea Grill and Pourhouse](http://www.marriott.com/hotel-restaurants/yhzmc-halifax-marriott-harbourfront-hotel/harbourstone/5470933/home-page.mi), in a Beer vs Wine Showdown. Five Courses of food are being prepared, with a wine and beer paired with each, with attendees voting on their favourites. Tickets are available through the Harbourstone now, via [email](mailto:harbourstone@marriott.com) or phone (902-428-7852).

• Fredericton's [Mama's Brew Pub](http://www.mamaspubwesthills.com/) will be releasing their fifth beer early next week, an American Amber Ale. A slightly bigger beer at 6.1% ABV than their other releases, it's lightly hopped with **East Kent Goldings** to 15 IBUs. The grist features Maris Otter, Crystal 70 L, Carafa and Wheat malt, lending the beer "toasted malt flavours and a pleasant fruitiness", according to brewer Ryan Kingston. They've also brought back their _Session IPA_, at 4.2% and 24 IBUs, it features lots of dry-hopping with **Citra** and **Comet** for a great blast of citrus hop character.

• Dartmouth's [Spindrift Brewing](http://spindriftbrewing.com/) will be continuing their **Seventh Wave** release today with _Blueberry Phie_. This 5.0% ABV Wheat Ale was aged on loose leaf Masala Chai Tea and PEI blueberry puree. Pouring with a thick white head (thanks to the high percentage of wheat in the malt bill), it features notes of blueberries, cardamom, cinnamon and vanilla, for an experience like tasting savory blueberry pie. As with all of their Seventh Wave series, this beer is only available at the brewery in growlers, and in extremely limited amounts (they tend to sell out Friday afternoon), so grab some now to avoid disappointment.

• [Gahan House Halifax](http://halifax.gahan.ca/) released a brand new beer last night, _Cranberry Sour_. The beer was produced using a 48 hour sour mash, allowing the _Lactobacillus _on the grain to produce lactic acid for a sour bite, and then the fermentation was completed with brewer's yeast. Cranberries were added after fermentation was complete, for a fresh aroma and tart character to complement the 3% ABV base beer. It is available on tap at the brewpub for pints, as well as growler fills.

• [Gahan House Charlottetown's](http://charlottetown.gahan.ca/) Brewmaster Trent Hayes will be hosting a Brewmaster dinner at [Fishbones Oyster Bar](http://fishbones.ca/) on Friday, March 11. Beginning at 7pm, Hayes will lead the four course meal of food and beer pairings, featuring local products in a beer-inspired presentation. Tickets are available now at both Fishbones and Gahan House.

• Details on the [Cape Breton Beer Fest](http://www.capebretonbeerfest.com/) were announced yesterday. Scheduled for Saturday, November 19th at the [Cruise Pavilion](http://www.sydneyport.ca/joan-harriss-cruise-pavilion/) on Esplanade in Sydney, there will be both an afternoon and evening session, each 2.5 hours (with evening VIP tickets allowing early entry). Featuring primarily craft breweries, including Cape Breton's own [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) and [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/), the organizers are aiming for about 35 breweries in attendance, from Nova Scotia, the Maritimes, and beyond. Food vendors will be onsite to provide sustenance to keep the party going, and other vendors will be invited to set up tables to showcase the best Cape Breton has to offer.

A few parting shots this week:

- [Distillerie Fils du Roy](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/) has brought back their spring seasonal, _Stella Maris._ This 7.5% ABV Biere de Garde is named in honour of the star in the Acadian flag. Look for it along the East coast of the province, and Fredericton, and check out Fils du Roy's other offerings through the [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Products?Search=Fils+du+Roy+&Type=Store&NewProductsOnly=false&OrderBy=ProductName&OrderAscending=true&Take=25&Skip=0&ProductClassSelected=&ProductLineSelected=&StoreSelected=&SugarLevelSelected=&VintageSelected=&ShowStores=&ShowSugarLevels=&ShowVintages=&ViewCategorySelected=&GrapeVarietySelected=&ShowGrapeVarieties=&Printable=).
