The 6th Halifax Seaport Beerfest, which was named “Favourite Beer Festival” in Canada’s beer magazine, TAPS, will take place Friday, August 10th (7:00 to 9:30pm)  and Saturday, August 11th (2:00 to 4:30 and 7:00 to 9:30).

Tickets will go on sale starting this Friday, May 18th at 11am  at the Ticket Atlantic box office, at all participating Atlantic Superstores, by phone at 451-1221 (1-877-451-1221) and [online](http://www.ticketatlantic.com/en/home/default.aspx).  Tickets will be available at select NSLC locations throughout the province starting Wednesday, June 13th.  The Saturday afternoon session is $40 per person in advance ($45 at the gate). The evening sessions are $45 per person in advance ($50 at the gate). Tickets at the gate are limited as sessions do sell out. Prices do not include tax and applicable surcharges (there will be no additional surcharge for tickets purchased through the NSLC).

BeerFest staff are working hard to coordinate the nearly 200 beers and ciders that arrive each year. Maritime favourites, like Picaroons and Rogues Roost, will join national
brands and European imports alike to show the quality and diversity that makes today’s beer market so interesting. Specialty pavilions will also return from Ontario, Quebec and
Maine.  In addition to samplings, event-goers can experience great live music by local musicians SoHo Ghetto, Keith Andrews and Petty Lacerny along with locally inspired cuisine from Taste of Nova Scotia restaurants.

“It will be two and a half hours of the most fun you’ll have all summer!” said Bruce Mansour, co-producer of the Halifax Seaport Beerfest. “When the beerfest is on, you
won’t want be anywhere else. Discovering and sampling great beer, enjoying fabulous local food and having fun in the sun, this is the place to be!”

A portion of the net event proceeds will again be donated to the official Festival charity - [Prostate Cancer Canada Atlantic](http://www.prostatecancer.ca/)
