Since opening in 2012, Moncton's [Tide and Boar Gastropub](http://www.tideandboar.com/) has been combining the best of local and craft beer with thoughtful food, including their very popular [Boar Poutine](https://www.google.ca/search?q=Boar+Poutine&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUqs6dl8LPAhXCNx4KHZF2DNsQ_AUICCgB&biw=1600&bih=699), along with hosting local music and events. Late last week they launched the first of their house-brewed beers, produced by one of the owners, and long-time homebrewer, Chad Steeves. We caught up with Chad to learn more about the new beers hitting the taps at T&B these days.

**Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and Tide and Boar?**
I am one of the owners of Tide & Boar Gastropub. We have been open for five years and have been trying our best to be a home to good beer, food and live music. After home brewing for the past five years I thought it was time to offer my own beers on tap.

**How did you get into the world of craft beer?
**I was in a pub in the Rockies thirteen years ago, when a British friend of mine passed me a 32oz glass of Guinness; I had asked him what this glass of black was and he said by the time you get to the bottom of it you’ll be a fan. He was right, and I’ve been trying new beer, while learning as much about it as possible.

**Do you have a favorite beer style, beer, or brewery you enjoy drinking?**
I'm a big fan of IPAs, love the hops!

**What made you decide to take the step into brewing professionally?
**It's something I have dreamed about for a long time and I finally felt I had the time to do it.

**What size/manufacturer/type of system are you be brewing on? Expected output (monthly, yearly, etc)?**
We are brewing on a 1 BBL (120 litre) electric system from [Ruby Street](http://www.rubystreetbrewing.com/),  along with seven 170 litre [Blichmann](http://www.blichmannengineering.com/) conical fermentors.

**Can you tell us about the beers you plan on offering?
**I’m planning on selling more "series of beers", with a lot of them being focused on different hops and malt blends. All hazy and unfiltered of course! In the Hoppy IPA vein, we started with the 5.9% ABV _Centennial/Simcoe/Citra_ (that sold out right away), and are currently serving _Apollo_ (which in addition to the eponymous hop, also features **Amarillo**, **Citra**, and **Pacific Gem**) and a _Fresh Hop Pale Ale_, also 5.9% ABV, featuring local **Cascade** and **Willamette**. We also currently offer a kettle sour series we're calling _Sour Otis_: this sub-5% ABV beer will be infused with whatever blend of in-season fruit or berries we can get. So far we have done a _Wild Raspberry Hibiscus_ (that’s already sold out), and on now is the _Blueberry Basil_; up next we have a _Field Grape & Lemon Zest_, with even more to come. The size of the system really means I can explore and try different ideas out. But for now, Hazy IPAs and Kettle Sours are what I have brewing in our tanks.

**Will you be sending beers out to other bars/restaurants, or offering growler fills?
**We do plan to send our beer to other bars and places when we can. We're not actively pursuing this option currently, but would be happy to put a keg here or there on request. I’m going to try to not keep it all here at the Tide & Boar.

**Have you had any assistance from other breweries/people in Atlantic Canada (or elsewhere)?**
Every brewery we work with at the Tide & Boar has been great and very supportive: in no particular order, [Grimross Brewing](http://grimross.com/), [Unfiltered](http://hoppyasballs.ca), [Beckwith Road](http://beckwithroad.com/), [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/), [Celtic Knot](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing), [Flying Boats](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710), [Bore City](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/), to name a few...

**Where do you hope to see your brewery in the next 2-3 years?**
Only time will tell!

**Anything else you'd like to share, we'd love pass it along.
**I guess I just want to emphasize that we will continue to carry and support the craft beer scene. I have no intention of not selling other craft breweries at the Tide & Boar - I love trying new beers. Our beers will only take up 2-4 lines at a time, and we currently have 14 draft lines.
