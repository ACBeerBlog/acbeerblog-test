[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cba_eng_rgb-e1315533082802.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cba_eng_rgb-e1315533082802.jpg)The [2012 Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/?p=92) will take place this June 8th and 9th in Montreal as part of the [19th Annual Mondiale de la Bière](http://festivalmondialbiere.qc.ca/en/festivals/mondial_de_la_biere_montreal_2012/).  This marks the first time that the event will take place outside of Toronto.  TAPS Media is committed to move the event to a new location each year and can officially consider this post the start of lobbying to bring it to Atlantic Canada in 2013!

This year will also see the expansion of the Awards Ceremony to include an additional daylong conference featuring speakers, seminars and networking events.  Speakers will include brewing pioneers, beer educators and more.

Atlantic Canadian Breweries have traditionally been very successful at this event.  Fredericton's Picaroons is the 2011 Brewery of the year with Moncton's Pump House Brewery having won the Award in 2005.  Garrison Brewing Company has also enjoyed success winning the Beer of the Year for their Imperial I.P.A. in both 2007 and 2008.

This is an event that is sure to be worth a trip to la Belle Province for any Beer Enthusiast.
