Pump House Brewery will be releasing a special edition Doppelbock to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its bottling plant.  Friday, December 7th at 5pm they will be tapping a Ferkin Keg of the brew and a bottled version of the beer will be available on ANBL shelves before Christmas for a limited time.  The beer is described as follows:**
**


<blockquote>The Doppelbock has 18.4% OE, a FE of 2.0%, which gives an alcohol content of 9% Vol.%.

The colour is a very dark brown with a reddish tint, the foam is beige, thick and long lasting.

The phenolic taste from the high alcohol content is barely noticeable, an intense maltiness, which is accompanied by a pleasant dark chocolate taste, ties it all together.

Hop bitterness is noticeable but not overpowering, as there is already enough bitterness from the dark malts.  A hint of citrussy hop aroma rounds the taste up.

This beer harmonizes very well with hearty food like stews and game, but is also a good companion to sweet desserts like chocolate mousse or Creme Bavaroise.</blockquote>
