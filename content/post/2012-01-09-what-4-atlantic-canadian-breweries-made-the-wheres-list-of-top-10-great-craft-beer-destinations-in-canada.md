This past September the Where blog created a [Top 10 list of Craft Beer Destinations in Canada](http://www.where.ca/blog/across-canada-10-great-craft-beer-destinations/) identifying one per province.

[Yellow Belly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) was identified for Newfoundland, the [Gahan House](http://www.gahan.ca/) for P.E.I., the [Rare Bird Pub](http://www.rarebirdpub.com/) in Guysborough for Nova Scotia and the [Pump House Brewery](http://www.pumphousebrewery.ca/) for N.B.Â  Check out the link for a picture and brief write up on each.
