G'day! Along with your weekly dose of regional beer news comes the announcement of yet another new brewery in Atlantic Canada. Let's get to it!

• Fredericton will soon be seeing the launch of the city's very first brewpub, as [Mama's Pub](http://www.mamaspubwesthills.com/) (a local establishment that has been operating on Fredericton's North Side for 23 years) plans to start brewing on a 2 BBL (~225 L) system in the near future. Manager Ryan Kingston will be the brewer, and has developed several "flagship beer" recipes with the help of brewer/consultant Andrew 'Esty' Estabrooks. They plan on launching their first three beers - an American Pale Ale, Brown Ale, and Session IPA - by Christmas, with Estabrooks staying on as consultant to see the brewery through its initial developing stages. All beers will be available on tap at Mama's only, with four seasonal rotating beers to follow in 2016. Plans currently include growler fills onsite sometime in the future, and there will be 15 other taps in addition to the Mama's beers. We'll have a Q&A posted in the near future; stay tuned!

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) has announced future plans to open a brewery and retail space in downtown St. Stephen. Located at [5 King St.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/5+King+St,+St+Stephen,+NB+E3L+2C1/@45.1927039,-67.2776154,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4ca5f934209deca5:0xf91b4f0be111e0f1), the establishment will be in collaboration with an "experienced chef", who will run a co-joined but separately-operated brewpub. Still in the development phase, the current working name is **The Five Kings**. We'll have more details in the future as they become available!

• We also have details on the opening date plans for [Battery Park Beer Bar](http://batterypark.ca/) in Dartmouth. This joint venture between [Brooklyn Warehouse](http://brooklynwarehouse.ca/) and [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) will be opening their doors December 10th. Why December 10th? Owner Leo Christakos is a board member of the [Slow Food NS](http://slowfoodns.com/) association, and their annual [Terra Madre Day](http://www.slowfood.com/what-we-do/international-events/terra-madre-day/) is on that date, celebrating the founding of Slow Food in 1989. The Terra Madre initiative is a celebration of local food (including beer) through community events, including meals, festivals, workshops and more. BPBB's opening will be a culmination of their months of preparation, and so it is fitting to hold it on that date. They will be pouring several new beers and current favourites, both brewed onsite and at North's Agricola Street location. As the exact timing and beer details are announced, we'll be sure to share them. And drop by North today after noon to pick up a bottle of _Two_, the beer brewed in celebration of [Stillwell's](http://www.barstillwell.com/) second anniversary.

• Moncton's [Pump House Brewery](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) has released the 2015 edition of their _Stonefire Ale_. It was brewed using the [Steinbier](http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/Steinbier.html) technique, which involves heating the wort not by heating a kettle, but by super-heating rocks to 700C and dropping them directly into the wort. This leads to lots of sugar caramelization, and even a faint hint of smokiness in the final product. The bitterness of the beer is very low, under 10 IBUs, leaving lots of room for the 6.5% ABV, with the beer coming through slightly sweet. It is widely available at the [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/ProductDetails/4851) in bottles now. Pump House has also brought back their _Bière de Garde_ seasonal, a 6.5% ABV amber beer with Belgian yeast character spiciness, and balancing hop bitterness from **Chinook** and **Golding**.

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is coming to Sackville, New Brunswick in the form of a massive tap-takeover at [Ducky's Bar](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar)! Starting tomorrow, November 21st, at 7 pm, there will be 18 taps pouring various Garrison beers, many of which are special releases such as_ Not So Gentle Tickle IPA_, _Double Jack Imperial Pumpkin Ale_, _3 Fields Harvest_, _Sweet Rye'd Harvest Wheat Ale_, and their _Proud Rose-Mary_, the "Gastronome IPA" normally exclusive to the [harbourstone sea grill & pour house](http://www.marriott.com/hotel-restaurants/yhzmc-halifax-marriott-harbourfront-hotel/harbourstone/5470933/home-page.mi) in Halifax. There is no cover charge, but if you purchase a ticket for $10, you will receive a specially-branded Belgian-style glass and five 5 oz drink tickets; sign up in advance at the bar, and you get an additional two drink tickets. Those with the branded glass will be able to purchase additional 5 oz pours for the special price of $2.25.

• In additional Garrison news, their seasonal _Winter Warmer_ is back, starting today. Just in time for colder temperatures, this 7% ABV dark beer is perfect for sipping, and, new this year, is available in 6-packs, perfect for sharing (or not!). And next Saturday, the 28th, will see the launch of this year's _Spruce Beer_, with a cask of both the Spruce Beer and Winter Warmer, as well as mulled cider, on at the brewery.

• [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) has officially set the date for this year's _Transmitter Coffee Stout_ [release](https://www.facebook.com/events/1519592271693338/). A delicious beer that was brewed in collaboration with local [Receiver Coffee Co.](https://www.facebook.com/receivercoffeeco/), last year's batch featured plenty of roasted coffee flavour and aroma, and was more than worth the Herculean task of getting the wax off the bottle cap! The 750 mL bottles will be available for purchase at the brewery starting at 5 pm next Tuesday (November 24th); there will be live music from [Dave Woodside](https://www.facebook.com/davidwoodsidemusic) until 7pm, and both PEIBC brewers and Receiver employees will be on hand to answer questions about the beer and coffee (with samples of both available for sampling). Like last year's batch, supplies will be limited, so load up while you have the chance! And for you procrastinators, there are still a few bottles available of _Hell Street_, their barrel-aged Doppelbock, at both the brewery and [PEILCC](http://www.peilcc.ca/).

• The seasonal beer re-release news doesn't stop there, as [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/)'s very popular Russian Imperial Stout, _Revolution_, is back for another year. Already in bottles and on tap at their Halifax and Dartmouth brewery shops, it will also be popping up soon at NSLC stores in the next few weeks. This dark, strong (8% ABV), complex ale features plenty of roasted and chocolate notes, along with a smooth, warming finish from the higher alcohol. For the first time, it will also be available at select [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Products?OrderAscending=true&Take=25&Skip=0&Search=propeller) locations by early 2016.

• [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) has just released _Gimme Simcoe_, the latest in the "Gimme" line of single-hop Pale Ales, with Bar Stillwell as conspirators. Weighing in at 5.0% ABV, this light-bodied brew showcases the **Simcoe** hop, added especially late in the process to magnify the hop's aroma and flavour over bitterness. On tap now at the brewery, and shortly at Stillwell and elsewhere in our region. And one final reminder, entry forms for the [Home Brew Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/815036745283070/) are due via email Nov 23rd, and beers must be submitted to the brewery, or the Halifax drop-point, no later than Friday the 27th.

• The [Nook and Cranny](http://thenookandcranny.ca/) in Truro has a new beer on tap at the pub. Their first dark beer is a 4.7% ABV _Milk Stout_, brewed on-site on their [SmartBrew](http://www.smartbrew.com/) system. Smooth-drinking, with a bit of roast and sweetness, it should be a great beer for the cooler months. Like the rest of their beers, it's currently available at the pub for pints and growler fills.

• The [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/) is holding a Holiday Brunch at Stillwell on December 6th. The party starts at noon with the launching of the [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/)/Big Spruce collaboration _Triskaidekaphobia_, plus some great brunch food from Chef Graeme Ruppel, including Eggs Benedict, Frittata, and Biscuits & Gravy. [Tickets are $32.40](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ladies-beer-league-holiday-brunch-2015-tickets-19590630102), and include food and first pour of _Tris_, and LBL members receive a $5 discount. Doors open at 4pm to the public.

That's it for this week! If you're in Charlottetown, [BarNone](http://@BARNONEBEER)'s award-winning Black IPA, _Black Eye P.A._, has returned; you can find it on tap at [Baba's Lounge](https://www.facebook.com/babasloungepei/?fref=ts) and [The Old Triangle](http://www.oldtrianglecharlottetown.com/welcome/). And another award-winning beer, _La Buckdjeuve_ from [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/), is currently pouring at all four ANBL growler stations, is available in bottles at the brewery now and in select ANBL locations starting next week (if you don't see it, ask for it!), for a limited time only. [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) has re-released their _Maritime Amber Ale_, a 5.6% ABV beer hopped towards the British side of the spectrum (earthy instead of fruity/citrusy). Finally, tomorrow is the third annual [Fredericton Poutine Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/798689210186550/); the sold-out event will feature 11 breweries pouring approximately 25 different different beers, ciders and mead, served with unlimited samples of over 12 different styles of poutine! Hope to see you there!
