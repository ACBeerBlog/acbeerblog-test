Here's an overview of Atlantic Canadian beer news and reading from this past week:

Excellent article from Craig Pinhey:  [Libations: Brewtopian dining ](http://eastcoastliving.ca/2011/03/libations-brewtopian-dining/)

[Brewnoser BPA](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2012/04/brewnoser-bpa-belgian-pale-ale.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed:+RockbottomBrewersBlog+%28Rockbottom+Brewers+Blog%29) is available on tap at Rockbottom Brewpub starting today.  So is [Blackness](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2012/04/blackness-robust-porter.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed:+HartAndThistleBrewersBlog+%28Hart+and+Thistle+Brewers+Blog%29), which is a "West Coast-style Robust Porter", at Hart & Thistle.

Here's what's [currently available](http://www.picaroonspub.com/profiles/blogs/brewtique-tap-listing-1) at the Picaroons Brewtique.  Don't forget about their [Easter Keg Hunt](http://www.picaroonspub.com/profiles/blogs/the-great-easter-keg-hunt) and to [send them a picture of your cat](http://www.picaroonspub.com/profiles/blogs/cat-contest).

Sample some [Propeller Bitter, IPA and Porter](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/content/TCT) as part of this week's Three Course Thursday at the Foggy Goggle.

The PEI Beer Guy has recently sampled [Alchemist Heady Topper](http://www.peibeerguy.com/2012/04/alchemist-heady-topper.html) and [Saint Bernardus' Grottenbier Bruin](http://www.peibeerguy.com/2012/03/saint-bernardus-grottenbier-bruin.html).

The guys from Darkside Brewing have tasting notes for the winner of Garrison's 2011 Ultimate Brew Off, [Garrison Schwarz](http://darksidebrewing.blogspot.ca/2012/03/local-beer-review-garrison-schwarz.html).

Here are tasting notes from [Old Brown Shoe from Meek Brewing](http://meekbrewingco.blogspot.ca/2012/04/tastingrecipe-old-brown-shoe.html).
