Happy Friday everyone! Grab a mug of coffee, or pint of Coffee Porter, as we've got another dose of beer news for you today.

• After a very successful response to their first release of _Session IPA_, [TrailWay Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) has brewed up another batch that should be released sometime today, or later this weekend. This easy-drinking and low-ABV (~4.4%) beer is hopped a bit differently than the previous one, featuring both **Centennial** and **Comet**. They also plan on releasing an Oatmeal Stout this weekend or shortly thereafter; coming in at around 5% ABV, it features up to seven different grain varieties in the mash, including plenty of roasted barley and chocolate malts - giving the beer "intense" flavors - as well as a good portion of organic oats to bump up the body.

• Speaking of TrailWay, they also have a brand new beer that they will be releasing during next Sunday's Superbowl party at the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/). A currently-unnamed American IPA, it was brewed with lots of **Comet**, **Amarillo**, **Centennial**, and **Cascade** hops, with Comet and Cascade also being used in the dry-hop, to give the beer lots of fruity and citrusy hop aromas. There's no charge to check out the Superbowl at the KSAH and try this new IPA; just drop in for a pint! They'll also have happy hour on regional beers, and food specials. And for those of you lucky enough to have tickets for the sold-out [New Brunswick Beer Tour](https://www.facebook.com/newbrunswickbeertours) next Saturday, you'll probably be getting a sneak preview of TrailWay's new IPA at the conclusion of the tour at KSAH!

• [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) has re-released their _SMaSH IPA_, and while brewed with the same malt (2-row) and hop variety (**Cascade**) as before, a different yeast strain was used for fermentation, resulting in a hoppier-tasting beer, according to owner/brewer Mitch Biggar. This very pale ale comes in at 5% ABV and 85 IBUs, and won't last long, so get to the brewery ASAP! Also, Mitch just brewed an "Orange Rye IPA", featuring six different malts, **Cascade** and **Goldings** hops, and real orange peel in the boil. Weighing in at ~7.7% ABV and 66 IBUs, look for this one to appear for growler fills at the brewery, soon.

• [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) has announced the results of last Sunday's judging of their [1st Annual Homebrew Competition](http://hrbrewing.ca/competition/): Mike Hebert and Jason Dobbelsteyn brewed the winning entry, and will get to brew a full-size batch of their [Christmas/Winter Specialty Spiced Beer](http://bjcp.org/2008styles/style21.php#1b) on the HR system with owner/brewer Shane Steeves today, to be released in the near future. Second and third place were awarded to Marc Melanson and Liam Walsh, respectively. Congratulations to the winners, and we'll have more info on the winning beer soon! Steeves had this to say about the event, "I was pretty happy with the turnout and had a lot of fun organizing it. I'll definitely open it to all of the Maritimes next year." Good news to the rest of the region's homebrewers. We'll be releasing details on this when we have them.

• And while we're on the topic on Hammond River, this is as good a time as any to mention that they've confirmed that they will be expanding some time in the future, likely to a 15 bbl (~17 hL) brewery (that's 15-times larger than their current setup). While the expansion is still in the planning stages, we're looking forward to having Hammond River beers more readily-available to the masses!

• As mentioned last week, [Antigonish Townhouse](https://antigonishtownhouse.wordpress.com/) will once again be featuring **Double Pumped Fridays** today. Today's bonus beer, joining _Terry's Bitter_ on the hand pumps, is _Terry's English IPA_. A traditional [English IPA](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style14.php#1a), with a focus on balanced bitterness and traditional English hop (earthy and floral, rather than citrus or resinous) and malt (caramel and biscuit) aroma and flavours. This light copper-coloured beer weighs in at 4.9% ABV, and 47 calculated IBUs from some **Cascade** early in the boil for bitterness, and more traditional English hops **Fuggles** and **East Kent Golding** used for flavour and aroma. Complementing the traditional recipe is the cask-conditioned character of the _IPA_ (and _Bitter_), and the Townhouse's hand pump helps to deliver the a perfect pint. The beer will be tapped at 4pm, and won't last long!

• And while you visit the Townhouse, perhaps you can sign up for their [Camino de Santiago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago)-inspired communal dinner, being held January 27th. Traditional Spanish fare from regions along the Camino and Spanish wine will be served, as well as photos and lively conversation about the walk from several previous trekkers. Tickets are $35, and can be reserved by [email](mailto:AntigonishTownhouse@gmail.com) or phone (02-863-2248).

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has announced that they will be releasing a Rum Barrel-aged version of their _Spruce Beer_ next weekend. Their 2013 release aged for 12 months in [Ironworks Distillery](http://www.ironworksdistillery.com/) Rum Barrels, was bottled earlier this month, and will be released Saturday, January 31st. They are holding a special day to commemorate it, **Cellar Saturday**. Details are a little thin, but we do know that they will be opening up the cellar to allow purchase of some of their bigger beers, worthy of cellaring and storing for months or years. The night before, they are hosting a vertical tasting of _Ol' Fog Burner Barley Wine_, where folks can try a few ounces of each of the 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015 releases, plus the 2011 Barrel-Aged release. Attendees will also be able to enjoy snacks, and have first dibs on the beers available in the cellar. There are just over a dozen tickets left, so contact Justin at the brewery (902-453-5343 x225) today to secure your spot.

• [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has announced that they will be celebrating [International Women's Day](http://www.internationalwomensday.com/) (March 8th) by teaming up with the [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/) to brew up something special, with a portion of the proceeds going to two local charities. The base style has not yet been decided, and the brewsters are looking for your input! [Vote here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/NHXQ5TB) for your favourite style. Also a quick note that the LBL has made their [memberships available online](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/?page_id=780), in case you haven't had a chance to attend one of their events. And look for a return of Boxing Rock's _The Darkness Cascadian Dark Ale_ in a few weeks, as they were brewing up another batch of this popular seasonal this week.

• In order to keep up with demand, [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) has installed more hardware at their Agricola Street location. They received a 13 hectolitre brite tank this week, and will be taking delivery of a 23 hectolitre fermentor in March. And keep an eye on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NorthBrewing) feed for a special one-off cask of cold-brewed coffee-infused Milk Stout to be served at [Smiling Goat Coffeehouse & Cafe](http://www.smilinggoat.ca/) at Bishop's Landing later this month.

• There are only a handful of tickets available for the [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/component/content/article/82-fredericton-craft-beer/online-tickets/77-online-tickets), March 7th at the [Fredericton Convention Centre](http://www.frederictonconventions.ca/). Breweries from all over the Maritimes and Quebec and Ontario will be attending and pouring their wares. The festival has also secured discounted rooms at the [Crowne Plaza](https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&eventID=12757237&utm_source=55344&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=47574431) immediately across the street, which will make for a very short trip to the next pub.

• And speaking of beer festivals, tickets for the [Full House Craft Beer Fest](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/499/full-house-craft-beer-fest) being held May 16 as part of the NS Craft Beer Week are still available, but the second session (4-7pm) is almost sold out. At $25 for 12 samples (additional samples are just $1), this will be a great opportunity to try almost all of the breweries and brewpubs in Nova Scotia in one place at one time. We expect to have more info on the Week very shortly, and will share the details with you.


• [rustik magazine](http://rustikmagazine.com/) wrote a feature on local breweries using local and innovative ingredients in their beers. [Check out the article](http://rustikmagazine.com/breweries-innovate-for-taste/#.VMGXg0fF-So), featuring Tatamagouche Brewing, [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/), and [Professor Gordon McOuat](http://www.ukings.ca/gordon-mcouat) of University of King's College, who teaches a course entitled [Brewing Science](http://www.ukings.ca/studies-early-modern-science-1500-1800-brewing-science-history-culture-and-science-beer).







• [Premier Wines & Spirits](http://premierwines.ca/store/) is moving! At the end of the month, they will be moving to a new location in the North End of Halifax, at the Sobeys at [2651 Windsor Street](https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=2651+Windsor+St,+Halifax&output=classic&dg=ntvo) (at the corner of North Street). To lighten the amount of inventory they will be moving, they are having a sale on many of their beers, wines, and spirits. We contacted manager Anthony Wight for some details on the sale and move, and he was able to give us the inside scoop: local (Pump House Red six-packs) as well as Canadian (Trou du Diable Grivoise de Noel), American (Anderson Valley Brother David's Double and Triple) and European (Buxton Special Pale Ale) beers are on sale for 10-20% off. And a bonus for anyone taking part in the moving sale, they will receive a coupon for 15% off at their new location. A new location also means a new name, **Rockhead Wine & Beer Market**. Premier will be closing Wednesday, January 28th, and RockHead will be open Thursday the 29th. In addition to a more convenient parking setup (ie, they have some!), the new location will be offering growler fills. Their growler station will have four beer on tap at a time, with a focus on Nova Scotia beer. They will be offering their own branded growler, but will also fill other breweries' 1.89 litre growlers, provided they are clean!







Be sure to track down some tasty and local beers this weekend! [Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) has just released their Amber Ale, _Louis XVII_, in bottles in NBLC stores across the province. [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) has been ramping up production to attempt to keep up with the high demand for their beers at their new brewery, and has a couple of old favorites - _Pugnatious Porter_ and _Rye IPA_ - now on tap for pours and growler fills. [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) hinted earlier this week that they've brewed another test batch of beer on their Brewtique system; they're keeping details under wraps for now, but their _SS Cocoa Beware_ is available at all four ANBL growler-fill locations this week; as always, check the [ANBL list](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) to see what is pouring near you. [Tatamagouche Brewing Co's](http://tatabrew.com/) collaboration with [Stubborn Goat Gastropub](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/halifax/), _Horns Over Hooves Double IPA_, has been spotted in the wild; catch it at the Goat, [Bar Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) and [Lion & Bright](http://lionandbright.com).
