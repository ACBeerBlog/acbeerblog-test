Happy Friday, everyone! Let's start your weekend off with a few news stories from around the Atlantic Region.

• [Two weeks ago](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/friday-wrap-up-20140110/), we mentioned the start of the "Name the Beer!" competition that [The Lunar Rogue](http://www.lunarrogue.com/) was having in collaboration with [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) to celebrate the Rogue's 25th Anniversary year. Well, the winner for the first beer has been selected - Duncan MacSporran, with his entry of "Parcel of Rogues", is the proud owner of a Picaroons Draft & Dinner Party for six, valued at $300. Picaroons has already brewed the beer, but they're still keeping silent on which style it is. However, you won't have long to wait - the official launch of _Parcel of Rogues_ will take place at the Rogue next Wednesday, January 29th at 7:00 pm.

• And hey, speaking of Fredericton... have you ever thought about knitting your own growler bag? No? Well, neither have we, but now's the time to learn! This Sunday, January 26th, [Yarns on York](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Yarns-On-York/261572517225228) is having a 3-hour workshop for all levels of knitters to instruct you on how you can make a handy item to carry your growler around. The $50 fee includes materials and taxes; check [here](http://www.edventures.ca/en/workshops/KnittingGrowlerFROSTival.asp) for more information.

• [Paddys Irish Brewpub](http://www.paddyspub.ca/) has released a new beer at both their Wolfville and Kentville locations. _Fitz's Belgian Dubbel_ follows the [style](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style18.php#1b) with a bronze-colored body, fruity and spicy aromas and flavors, light bitterness (with 25 IBUs), and "lively" carbonation. At 7% ABV, the beer has a pleasant warming sensation that is perfect for this time of year! Drop in at either location to try this new beer at the brewpub or get your growler filled.

• Looks like the [Hart & Thistle](http://www.hartandthistle.com/) has a new batch of brewmaster Greg Nash's popular _Commissar_, a [Russian Imperial Stout](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style13.php#1f). A full-bodied stout with "notes of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, raisins and figs", it's nicely balanced with enough bitterness at 117 IBUs (calc) to even things out. At 11% ABV, here's another beer to warm you on these cold winter days and nights!

• Mike Buhler of the [Beerthief](http://www.beerthief.ca) Artisanal and Craft Beer group is hosting a Chimay Cheese, Beer and Food tasting at [Clinched Bistro](http://www.chinchedbistro.com/), January 29th. Pairing both cheese and beer from the [Abbey of Notre-Dame de Scourmont](http://www.chimay.com/en/abbaye-de-chimay-bieres-trappistes-fromages-cisterciens-scourmont.html?IDC=271), will be creations from Clinched's co-owners Shaun Hussey (winner of [2012 Gold Medal Plates](http://goldmedalplates.com/site/?p=4531)) and renowned pastry check Michelle LeBlanc, including Salt Cod and Lobster Bubbly Bake, Chicken and Waffles, and Chocolate, Cherries and Almonds pastries (actually paired with Liefmans Cuvee Brut). Tickets for the event are $165, and can be reserved by emailing [Tom Beckett](mailto:tom.beckett<at>nl.rogers.com).

• [Robbie Burns Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns) is tomorrow, and [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has brewed up a few casks of Scotch Ale to celebrate. They released them to a few of your friendly neighbourhood bars, so be sure to grab a pint or two to celebrate along with fellow fans of The Bard, while enjoying some haggis. Look for it at [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/), [Ceilidh's Pub](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ceilidhs-Pub/585173001522110) (tapped at 4:00 pm), and at [The Loose Cannon](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Loose-Cannon-Pub/256468423163?fref=ts) (to be tapped at 11:00 am).

• Speaking of Garrison, a little birdy (aka Twitter) has told us that their very popular Spruce Beer will be taking the ferry over to Newfoundland in the next little while. Look for it on the shelves of [NLC](http://www.nlliquor.com/) stores mid- to late-February.

• Big Congratulations to [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) in Halifax. In addition to this week being their one-year anniversary, last night they won the **New Business of the Year** from the [Halifax Chamber of Commerce](http://www.halifaxchamber.com/content/HBA_2014_Finalists). With expanded capacity, thanks to a few larger fermentation vessels, look for Bridge on tap at more and more establishments around the province in 2014. Well done to Peter, Josh and the whole Bridge family!

That's all of the news for this week. Just a note that we had a wonderful time at the[ Local Connections Craft Beer and Local Food](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.582798398456570.1073741841.155163541220060) event last Thursday. Despite getting sprayed by an over-pressurized cask (not all bad when it's whiskey-infused Oatmeal Stout), the evening went off without a hitch! Great to see so many craft beer brewers and fans in one place. And then on Saturday, we had a great time for the Stillwell [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) and [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) tap takeover, and had great conversations again with the brewers and beer fans. Remember that craft beer can be as much about the great people behind the beer, as the beer itself!
