Good morning! As we enter the final couple of crazy days before Christmas, beer news is winding down (ever-so-slightly) as everyone rushes to fit in some last minute shopping, cooking, baking, and stressing. As an excuse to step away from it all, even for just a few minutes, let's take some time to get caught up on what's happening in the beer world this week...

• Just in time for Christmas, Saint John's [Loyalist City Brewing](http://loyalistcitybrewing.ca) has launched their first beer, _Lupulus Interruptus_. This 7.5% American IPA features loads of late and whirlpool hops, for an assertive 90 IBU bitterness, enhanced by juicy notes of citrus and peach in both the flavour and aroma. This first batch is currently available at Uptown's [Cask & Kettle](http://caskandkettle.com/), as well as for growler fills at the [Wellington Row ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=wellington). Drop in today for a fill/pint, as both spots are moving through the beer quickly! To learn more about Loyalist City, check out our [Profile](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/08/26/loyalist-city/) on them from the summer. Look for more LCBC beers to be available in early January, with their retail and taproom location on Water Street to open in the coming months. Keep an eye here, as well as on their [social](http://www.twitter.com/loyalistcity) [media](https://www.facebook.com/loyalistcitybrewing/) pages.

• In cider news, [Annapolis Cider Company](http://drinkannapolis.ca/) in Wolfville has a brand new offering this week in the form of their _Old-Fashioned Gravenstein_, made with 100% hand-picked local Gravenstein apples, an heirloom variety that’s great for both eating and cooking, but which doesn’t store well on a long-term basis. The apples for this cider were harvested early and pressed soon after picking providing juice that was fermented dry. After fermentation, additional fresh-pressed Gravenstein juice was added for balance and it the cider was finished with a slight effervescence. The final product is pale in colour with a fresh apple aroma and crisp flavor. It comes in at 7.4% and is being sold in a refillable bottle for $19.95; it’s available either on its own or as part of a Holiday 3-Pack for a limited time.





• There's a whole slew of special one-offs being released right now at [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com), and continuing on over the next several weeks. They've brewed up another iteration of their _Berliner Weisse_, with this batch tasting more sour than the first. Still a very-sessionable 4% ABV, four kegs of this one were made available: two plain, and two dry-hopped (one with **Centennial**, one with **Sorachi Ace**). They're available for pints only at the taproom, and they're going fast!






• Continuing with Upstreet, last week they released _Into the Weeds_, a "Seaweed Blonde Ale". This beer was created by employee Jesse H, and featured a simple grist of 2-row and light Crystal malt, with both sea lettuce and dulse added late in the boil, and as a "dry-weed" addition after fermentation. With a blend of "sweet, salty, and umami" flavours, it was another sessionable brew, at 4% ABV. Unfortunately, the two kegs flew out of the taproom even faster than expected! Maybe they'll brew it again sometime in the future...?

• Finally, expect to see many more one-offs released by Upstreet over the next couple of weeks, including a _Vanilla Smoked Porter_, _Honey Pilsner_, and more. And with a fresh delivery of barrels from Kentucky's [Buffalo Trace Distillery](https://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/), there will be some special beers coming in the New Year. As always, we'll keep you updated!

• If you're in the Moncton area, you're in for a special treat - [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301) officially launched their Lambic-style beer, _Zirable_, at the [Laundromat](https://foursquare.com/v/laundromat-espresso-bar/4c93e89338dd8cfa5d02c462) yesterday evening. Fermented in Hungarian medium-toasted oak barrels, this sour, complex, 5% ABV ale has been maturing for three years. It made a brief appearance at the 2014 Brewer's Bash as a young release (where, we can attest, it was already tasting pretty fantastic), and at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) in 2015, but the rest of it has been patiently awaiting it's release to the public, allowing the _Brettanomyces b_ruxellensis__ and _Lactobacillus_ plenty of time to work their magic. Several batches were actually brewed over this time period, where they were meticulously blended by brewer Patrice Godin, until the perfect balance and blend was found. This award-winning beer (Silver in the 2015 ACBAs) is a very limited release, so don't miss the chance to try the only [Gueuze-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gueuze) beer (blended lambics) brewed in the Maritimes (to our knowledge, anyway).

• Along with the first can releases of their _Good Aura_ and _Rascal_ earlier this week, [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) has a new beer (of sorts) newly available for the holiday. _Christmas Rascal_ is a new take on their Imperial Stout; inspired by Mexican Chocolate, they infused the base beer with Lactose powder, and then aged it (briefly) on cacoa nibs, cinnamon, cayenne, cardamom and vanilla. The result? A rich, full-bodied, and full-flavoured 8% ABV beer, with just the right amount of spice and heat. A small amount of this one is on tap for pints and growlers at the brewery's taproom, with the rest available this weekend at all ANBL growler stations (except Fredericton and Dieppe).





• River Charlo, New Brunswick’s [Savoie’s Brewhouse](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Savoies-Brewhouse/1617785005132093?fref=ts) has settled nicely into their new digs next to [Heron’s Nest Pub](https://www.facebook.com/HeronsNestPub/); they tell us it’s great being right next door to the only craft and imported beer pub in the area, with their own beer exclusively on tap and a variety of alternatives in the fridge. This week they’ll be serving up their _Holiday Peppermint Blonde_, a 5% ABV beer with both peppermint and vanilla added to the secondary for a seasonal flavour kick.​






• Fredericton's [Bogtrotter](https://www.facebook.com/BogtrotterCraftBrewery/) has their first Stout appearing in ANBL stores this week. _Snapping Turtle_ has a fairly standard grist with darker malts, as well as some Rye malt and oatmeal, all weighing in at only 4.8% ABV. Hopped entirely with **Chinook** to 25 IBUs, expect to see 500 mL bottles at the Oromocto, York St., and Prospect St. ANBL stores; it's also currently on tap at the [Cask & Kettle](https://www.facebook.com/caskandkettle/). Also, Bogtrotter launched _Snowy Spruce_ last week, which is their _Muddy Mayhem IPA_ with a Christmas twist - spruce buds (harvested from owner/brewer Rod Croucher's property) were added to boost the beer's aroma. This one is available on tap only, at better beer establishments in Fredericton.

• In St. John’s, [Mill Street](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) pub’s head brewer Dan Boldrini has come up with a new beer that celebrates a native Newfoundland foodstuff, the touton, a pancake of sorts often made with leftover bread dough and traditionally cooked in rendered pork fatback (although more often in canola oil or olive oil and clarified butter these days). _Touton Topper_ is an Imperial Stout infused with Crosby’s Molasses, a favourite go-with for toutons. The beer has a bit of a smoky nose and brings blackstrap molasses flavours with dark chocolate, roasted coffee and 25 or so IBUs providing balance. At a hefty 9.1% ABV it’s not for the faint of heart.​

• Starting yesterday, and continuing today until 4 pm, Moncton's [Tide & Boar Brewing](http://www.tideandboar.com/) began selling growlers to go of their beer for the first time. Set up in the adjoining Duo Cafe, a limited supply of kegs have been pouring several beers, including the recently-released _Peach Ale Shake_ and _Sour Otis Cranberry_, as well as two brand new beers, _Herbie's Oatmeal for Breakfast Stout_, and _Simcoe IPA_. ANBL-branded growlers will be on-hand for purchase, but they will also fill any (clean) 32 oz or 64 oz growler. In addition, branded men and women's t-shirts will be available, just in case you're looking for a last-minute Christmas gift for the beer lover in your life (or yourself)!

• [Graystone](http://graystonebrewing.com/) has a couple of new beers on tap, bringing the grand total of their beers at their taproom to 10, a new high. _Summit IPA_ (6.9% ABV, 74 IBUs) is not a single-hopped beer, but does feature plenty of **Summit** for a "subtle, earthy sweetness and clean finish", according to the brewery. They're also now pouring their _Holiday Stout_, which is their _Pitch Stout_ infused with cranberries and cocoa nibs; this one weighs in at an easy-drinking 4% ABV, and 38 IBUs. Both beers are available now for growler and crowler fills, as well as pints, and have been spotted at other beer bars/restaurants in Fredericton.

• [Earlier this month](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/12/02/friday-wrap-up-20161202/) we told you about _Ask & Embla_, the first beer in [North Brewing’s](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) “Finite Series” of experimental beers, when it was released to local taps. That beer is now available in 650mL bombers at both North bottle shops. It’s the same beer at 5.2% ABV and 16 or so IBU, with 20% oats in the grist, [Timothy hay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy-grass) added to the mash, a yeast pitch collected from _Saison de Pinot_ and 3 weeks of aging on driftwood collected from Cow Bay, but now it’s been conditioning in the bottle for an extra month. Given the mixed strain nature of the yeast, the extra fermentables used to bottle carbonate could definitely make some differences to the finished product and make it a candidate for cellar aging as well.





• We also told you a few weeks ago about North’s new Artist Series of labels. One beer in particular, the _Farmhouse Red_ Bière de Garde, isn’t just sporting a new label by Nicole G. (who you may know from the Halifax bottle shop), it’s also rocking a slightly new formulation: although the recipe is essentially the same as their _Farmhouse_, the new batches of this beer contain malt from [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) for additional local cred.




• The gang at [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) is laying fairly low this week in terms of releases and events, but it sounds like this is the calm before the storm and they'll be revving back up to full speed in the new year. This week does see the re-release of _Whackity Shmackity Brew_, a 5.8% ABV and 25 IBU American wheat beer featuring orange zest added to the fermenter and **Magnum**, **Amarillo** and **Mandarina Bavaria** hops, brewed in tribute to comedian Patton Oswalt.











• Coming early in the new year, with more info to come, are three new beers: _Sickbot Epidemic ESB_, a collaboration with [Sickboy Podcast](http://www.sickboypodcast.com/), a collaborative brew with North Brewing that might be named _220 Volts_, but then again might not be, and an as-yet totally unnamed Barleywine. We’ll have more details as the release dates approach.




• If you’re looking for a place to have a beer on one of the days most bars are closed over the holidays, remember that Good Robot is looking out for you. They’ll be open Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day, “at the staff’s request.” (Tune in this summer when the staff “requests” the honour of digging a defensive trench around the Gastroturf.) And on New Year’s Eve the GR gang will also be celebrating a No Frills New Year's with nothing but beer, glasses to serve it in and some finger foods from [Rinaldo’s](https://www.facebook.com/RinaldosHfx/).​




• Mahone Bay's [Saltbox Brewing](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) has a pair of new beers pouring at their taproom on Main Street these days. _Irish Red_ is a 4.8% ABV malt-forward Red Ale, light and easy drinking, with some pleasant fruity hop and light roasted notes. Due to its popularity, it will be joining their flagship lineup. Also drop by for a pint or growler of _Batch 56_, a light-bodied lager with a nice malt character and light fruity hops. Weighing in at 5.4% ABV, it hits all of the right buttons. Their taproom is open Christmas Eve until 6pm, and will re-open **December 27** for a Family Pot-Luck event from noon, bring your leftovers and share with the local beer community.


• Be sure to drop by [Schoolhouse Brewing](http://schoolhousebrewery.ca/)'s new location at [40 Water Street](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Schoolhouse+Brewery/@44.9953879,-64.140937,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4b59a8a7ad4b8f03:0x3ff0a69e4219cdc7!2s40+Water+St,+Falmouth,+NS+B0P+1L0!3b1!8m2!3d44.9953879!4d-64.1387483!3m4!1s0x4b59a8a6510fbdeb:0x89a607b784c0aa7c!8m2!3d44.9953879!4d-64.1387483) in Windsor today, as [Class is in Session](https://www.facebook.com/events/1115666198551483/)! Grab flights and growlers of their core lineup noon to 8pm, as well as a brand new brew, _Vice Principal_ Pale Ale. The 5.2% ABV American Pale Ale is a bigger take on the _Principal Pale Ale_, with a crisp finish and lighter aromatics. Look for it to be pouring at the [Local Connections Craft Beer and Local Food](http://localconnections.ca/home/craft-beer-2017) Event January 12th.




• Fredericton's [Maybee Brewing](http://www.maybeebrew.com/) has a new English Ale out now, _Slanty Shanty_ Best Bitter, which we mentioned briefly last week. A higher-proof Bitter at 5.0% ABV, it features authentic Noble spicy hop notes (ending up at 35 IBUs), with a touch of honey and grain in the glass. It is available at the brewery for growler fills, and making its way to better beer bars around the province.

• Nova Scotia’s breweries received some good news earlier this week, with an announcement that there are changes coming to the controversial Retail Sales Markup Allocation. The RSMA is collected by the NSLC on all beer that breweries sell directly to customers and licensees (i.e., not through the NSLC). Promoted as an ostensible means to track the volume of beer sold outside the Corporation, the $0.50/litre tax is charged in addition to excise and other taxes required by legislation. Halifax’s [Unfiltered Brewing](http://hoppyasballs.ca/) [launched a lawsuit](https://www.localxpress.ca/local-business/halifax-microbrewery-launches-court-challenge-of-nslc-retail-markup-fee-356545) against the NSLC in August characterizing the RSMA as a tax and calling its validity into question based on the further question of whether the NSLC has a mandate to tax producers in this way. Unfiltered raised awareness in October with the release of their _RSMA Double IPA_ and has seen support from Big Spruce’s [open letter to Nova Scotia](http://localconnections.ca/home/open-letter-to-nova-scotia) as well as a donation of malt from [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) that they used to brew their most recent batch of _DOA_. The province says that as of April 1, 2017, the RSMA will be reduced to 5% of wholesale costs, which should lead to a reduction of the overall amount collected from brewers in Nova Scotia to one-third of current levels. While a noble start, and the first time breweries will be treated in the same was as other alcohol producers, many breweries (including Unfiltered) would prefer to see this fee eliminated completely. Credit is certainly due for the inclusion in the press release of [Craft Brewer’s Association of NS](http://nscraftbeer.ca/) president Emily Tipton’s comments regarding the extended economic impact of craft beer and brewing in Nova Scotia. The province’s press release can be read [here](http://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20161220005).

That's all the news fit to print this week, folks! Have a safe and happy holiday, and we'll see you back here next week with the final Wrap-Up of the year!
