INNIS & GUNN TO RELEASE CANADA DAY 2012 BEER SHOWCASING CANADIAN ARTWORK

ARTIST GARY WHITLEY CHOSEN AS FEATURED ARTIST ON SCOTTISH BREWER’S MAY 2012 RELEASE OF THE LIMITED EDITION ‘CANADA DAY 2012’ BEER PACKAGING

Toronto: Innis & Gunn, brewers of Canada’s favourite Scottish beer, today announced that each bottle of its Limited Edition‘Canada Day 2012’ beer will be packaged in cartons featuring original artwork by British Columbia-based artist, Gary Whitley.Released every May to celebrate Canada’s birthday and to recognize the country’s special contribution to the Innis & Gunn story, the Canada Day brews are available by the bottle at fine beer, wine and spirits retailers across the country in very limited quantities.This is the second release from Innis & Gunn to feature original Canadian artwork.

“When I received word that Innis & Gunn was searching for artwork for its Canada Day Beer packaging, it was instantly clear that I had to submit Emblems – a painting of sugar maple saplings I created years ago and had kept at home,” said artist Gary Whitley, AFCA, SCA. “As a born and raised Canadian, I couldn’t think of a more iconic symbol of this fine country.”

Gary’s design was chosen from a group of over 60 members from the Society of Canadian Artists (SCA) by a judging panel that included 2011-featured artist, Deborah Colvin. In December 2011, members of the non-profit artists’ organization dedicated to expanding the visibility and stature of visual arts in Canada were asked to submit original artwork that best reflected the country’s rich tapestry.

“We were very delighted to once again receive so many beautiful pieces of artwork from the members of the Society of Canadian Artists,” said Innis & Gunn international brand manager Nicol Rennie. “Gary’s design garnered the most votes for our ‘Canada Day 2012’ packaging and captures a scene so prevalent across the country that Canadians can truly connect with.”

“We are very proud to again spotlight a member of the extremely talented Canadian art community,” said Innis & Gunn owner and brewer Dougal Sharp. “We feel Gary Whitley’s work perfectly reflects the pride and spirit of Canadians and we are excited to share this specially crafted, oak-aged brew with our largest export market,” concluded Sharp.

About Innis & Gunn

Innis & Gunn Oak Aged Beer was accidentally discovered and developed by Dougal Sharp in 2003. Initially approached by a Scotch whisky distillery to make a beer-finished whisky, the brewery recognized the exceptional quality of the special beer they created and poured away after seasoning their oak barrels. Using this revolutionary technique of aging beers, the American white oak barrels infuse Innis & Gunn's Original Oak Aged Beer with toffee and vanilla flavours and aromas during a special maturation process. This new category has managed to attract many new drinkers to beer both in the UK and across its six major export markets (Canada, USA, Ireland, Sweden, Norway and Finland). Early 2010, Innis & Gunn was named 'Business of the Year' at the annual Scotland Food & Drink Excellence Awards and also became the first Scottish beer company in 22 years to be handed the prestigious Queen's Award for Enterprise: International Trade. Represented by Peter Mielzysnski Agencies Ltd., Innis & Gunn brews are available at fine wine, beer and spirit retailers across Canada.
