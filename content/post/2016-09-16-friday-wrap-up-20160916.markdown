Happy Friday everyone! Another busy week, so let's dive right in!

• It's been a busy few weeks at [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/), and they're ready to share the fruits of their labour! Yesterday, they released their first kettle sour beer, brewed in collaboration/conspiracy with [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/). _I'm In Love_ is a 4.0% ABV Berliner Weisse, featuring 70kg of [ground cherries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physalis) added after primary fermentation was complete. The resulting beer has quite a tropical feel, with melon and cantalope notes, aided by light additions of **Mandarina Bavaria** and **Mosaic** hops (to 13 IBUs). This beer will be a draft-only release, so grab a growler at the brewery, or a pint at better watering holes in the province. And we have it on good authority that this will not be the last TataWeisse release; we'll keep you up to date with future releases.

• Launching at TataBrew today, is the third in their **Barrel Aged Belgian Golden Strong** series of beers. The _Blackberry and Cherry_ spent an extra month in its barrel, as compared to the earlier releases of the _Raspberry_ and _Strawberry and Ginger_ versions. As such, this release, while still clocking in at 7.8% ABV, does show more barrel (vanilla and oak) and fruit (the eponymous blackberry and cherry, but also subtle sherry) characters. As with the other two releases, there are only a dozen cases of this beer available, so be sure to drop by the brewery this weekend to avoid disappointment.

• Tata's _Lagerhosen_ will be back next week, just in time for next weekend's [Tatamagouche Oktoberfest](http://www.nsoktoberfest.ca/). The 4.5% ABV lager will be available in cans, as well as growler fills and of course on tap. They are running a contest on Facebook for swag, tickets to Oktoberfest, and a case of beer, so be sure to [check it out](https://www.facebook.com/tatabrew/photos/a.1598360323737712.1073741829.1423201444586935/1643747845865626/?type=1&theater)! And we've spotted a new brew in the works with [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/), slated to be released at Tatabrew tap-takeover there on Thursday, **October 6th**, where a grand total of 14 Tatabrew beers will be featured on tap, along with one cask. Keep it dialed here for the details on this West Coast-inspired beer when available!

• The [Port Rexton Brewing](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) crew have been busy lately, and will be launching a brand new beer (to both them, and to the Rock, we reckon), a _Gose_. This 4.0% German-inspired beer features hand-picked and freshly-cracked coriander seed from the gardens and greenhouse at nearby [Fisher's Loft Inn](http://fishersloft.com/). And in more exciting PRB news, they made their first delivery into St John's this week: two kegs of _T-Rex Porter_ were delivered to [The Adelaide Oyster House](https://www.facebook.com/theadelaideoysterhouse/) Wednesday evening. Expect there to be more deliveries to town when supply allows it.

• [Bore City](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/) has brewed up their very first Imperial IPA - with a grist made up mainly of 2-row, there's a decent amount of flaked grains to boost the body (and add haze), and just the tiniest amount of CaraMunich malt. Hopped and dry-hopped with heavy amounts of **Equinox**,** Galaxy** and** Topaz**, those of you lucky enough to try this currently-unnamed DIPA can expect big blasts of citrus and tropical fruit. Fermented with a blend of English and American ale yeasts, it weighs in at 8.5% ABV and 75 IBUs. Your best bet to try this delicious-sounding beer? Next Saturday's (Sept 24th) Atlantic Canada Craft Brew Oktoberfest in Moncton; [tickets are still available here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/atlantic-canadian-craft-brew-oktoberfest-tickets-26413113333).

• As wet-hopped-beer season continues, [Maybee Brewing](http://www.maybeebrew.com/) recently brewed their first, a SMaSH featuring all Maris Otter malt and freshly-harvested **Columbus** hops from [Southan Farms](http://www.southanfarms.net/). A hop variety that has been around for years, Columbus offers a pleasant mix of dank, earthy, and resinous aromas and flavours, which should be amped up even more when used fresh. Expect this one to come in between 5.5-6% ABV, and to hit taps in the next week or so. It will also be released in 473 mL cans, which will be available exclusively at the brewery in Fredericton.

• Florenceville-Bristol's [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) has a new brew available at the brewery, and another following soon. Their _Biggar's Extra Special Bitter_ is an English ESB brewed with 2-row, Munich, Crystal 40 L, and Chocolate malts, and hopped entirely with English **Goldings**. At 6.2% ABV and 47 IBUs, it's available now for growler fills and pints. Brewed recently is a _Smoked Vanilla Whisky Porter_; this 9.9% ABV monster features a combination of roasted and smoked malts, as well as 8 lbs of blackstrap molasses. In addition, whisky-aged oak chips and 35 vanilla beans were added in secondary. Finally, the beer was dry-hopped with Goldings. Look for this one to become available on tap at the brewery within the next couple of weeks.

• We reported last week on [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/)'s first sour beer, which was kettle-soured with a _Lactobacillus_ blend from [Escarpment Labs](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/). That beer is nearing completion, and should be available sometime next week. We can now confirm that it will be a ~5% ABV hoppy sour ale; it was "generously whirpool-hopped" with **Galaxy**, and further dry-hopped with **Citra**. With the IBUs kept extremely low (high bitterness can easily clash in sour beers), expect a quite tart beer with loads of tropical fruit on the nose and palate.

• There's another new brew on tap at [Mama's Brew Pub](http://www.mamaspubwesthills.com/), an American Wheat Ale named _Atlantic Great White_. Featuring a simple grist of 50% each of 2-row and Wheat malt, it was hopped with the tropical/citrus **Amarillo** variety. Crushed coriander was also added in the boil, followed by fresh apples and oranges in secondary. Easy-drinking at 4.9% ABV and 17 IBUs, this one is - as always - available only at the brewpub for pints and tasters.

• After several months delay, Fredericton's [Gray Stone Brewing](http://graystonebrewing.com/) has finally received and commissioned their 11.5 hL (10BBL) brewhouse. As such, they've been brewing like mad this week, with at least three batches currently on the go, including their first wet-hopped beer - _American Harvest IPA_ - which will be brewed this coming Sunday. Bittered with freshly harvested **Summit** to an approximated 85 IBUs, according to the brewery, the beer is expected to come in at 6.5% ABV. They are also putting out a call for any interested parties growing hops on their property to drop them off at the brewery by closing-time on Saturday, to be used in the brew in the flavour and aroma additions. Look for the first in-house-brewed releases to come late September/early October. Congratulations!

• With the return of fall comes the inevitable return of pumpkin beers. Last year, [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) released their _Gravedigger_, which is returning with a couple of changes: this year's batch weighs in at a slightly-lower 6.5% ABV (compared to last year's 7.5%), and exhibits slightly less graham cracker character in the flavour. The beer will officially launch **tonight** with the [Gravedigger Ghost Tour and Beer Release](https://www.facebook.com/events/1075873082481335/), with a Ghost Tour starting at [Captain Jack's Bar & Grill](https://www.facebook.com/CaptainJacksCharlottetown/) at 6pm, and ending up at Upstreet at 8pm to join the party in full swing. And big congratulations to them for winning [Startup Canada's](http://startupaward.ca/blog/2016/08/31/2016-startup-canada-award-winners-atlantic/) Social Enterprise Award, recognizing them for making a difference in, and helping to build, their community.

• And in an interesting mesh where wet-hopped-beers-meet-pumpkin-ales, [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co-301456876447/) has brewed up their _Indian Beach Pumpkin Ale_, which features additions of real pumpkin, and is wet-hopped with freshly-harvested **Cascade** from [Dunhams Run](http://dunhamsrun.ca/). As always, the beer also has cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and clove added to boost the pumpkin pie presence, resulting in an interesting flavour combination for this ~5% ABV brew. They have also brewed a wet-hop version of their _FogBound Hemp Pale Ale_, swapping out **Cascade** for Dunham Run's **Hallertauer** and **Nugget**. Look for these beers to hit the taps at the end of the month.

• Charlottetown's [Gahan House](http://charlottetown.gahan.ca/) has just released the details of this year's Home Brew Challenge. Amateur brewers from the Island are encouraged to brew up their best _Winter Warmer_ by **November 18th**, when it will be judged by a panel of beer experts. The winning brewer will then get to brew her/his recipe with Gahan's Brewmaster Trent Hayes (plus a cash prize!), and will be launched in 2017. Register [via email](mailto:gahan@murphyrestaurants.ca) by **September 30th**, and more details are available on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TheGahanHouse/photos/a.565348890158335.154218.562767907083100/1498725540153994/?type=3&theater).
