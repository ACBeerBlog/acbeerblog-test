Along with about 998 other people, acbbchris and acbbshawn were lucky enough to be in attendance at the 2nd Annual [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) at the [Fredericton Convention Centre](http://www.frederictonconventions.ca/) last Saturday, March 8th. With a bigger venue, more ticket-holders, and more brewers and beers than last year, the event was an even bigger success this time around!

To recap, there were 700 "regular" admission ticket-holders, who were allowed unlimited 2 oz samples of the beers available, from 7:30 pm to 10 pm. The 250 VIP ticket-holders were allowed entry an hour earlier, beginning at 6:30 pm. On top of this, there were also about 50 "Women's VIP" tickets sold; ladies with these tickets had some beer education starting at 6 pm, and they also received a larger keepsake glass.

All proceeds from the festival will be donated to [Team Diabetes](http://www.diabetes.ca/how-you-can-help/team-diabetes) (who also had a booth at the fest, selling tickets for their Beer for a Year drawing... more details on that in [last Friday's post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/friday-wrap-up-20140307/)). Approximately $14,000 was raised for this well-deserving charity, along with an additional $1200 from the Beer for a Year ticket sales!

We had a great time at the festival, and were very impressed with the improving quality of beer brewed and available in our region. Stay tuned later in the week, when the crowd-selected Best of the Festival will be announced! Next year's festival has already been determined to be on Saturday, March 7th, 2015.

And don't forget, there's less than a month (April 5th) until the [Saint John Beer Festival](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest)... tickets are selling fast, so don't wait much longer to get yours! We'll have more details on the SJBF soon.
