With the [Halifax Seaport Beerfest](http://seaportbeerfest.com/) happening this weekend, we wanted to give attendees (and those on the fence whether to attend) some more details on the fest.

This year's most exciting element is the _Cask Beer Pavillion_, being run by [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/) and the [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/). We reached out to Christopher Reynolds from Stillwell for more details on this endeavour. "We put a call out to the breweries that are a) Producing casks at all, b) Producing relatively good/stable casks, and finally c) Breweries we thought might participate. The format will be similar to Stillwell, in that we will aim for the best mix of FIVE casks at any given time, and we'll be tapping new ones as casks run out. There are three casks from some producers (Garrison, Big Spruce), but only ONE cask from some (Hell Bay), so we're not sure which session will get what -- which is part of the fun, we think." You can see Christopher and Beerfest co-founder Brian Titus chat casks in [this clip from Global Morning News](http://globalnews.ca/video/1486806/cask-beer-pavillion).

From Christopher and the brewers, we were able to secure a partial list of the fifteen-plus casks being poured:

[Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/): _Pump Le Mousse_ (a new beer, a Grapefruit Wheat), _Tip of the Spear IPA_ (a Black Spruce tip IPA), and _All Night Kitchen Party_ (a dry-hopped version of their _Kitchen Party Pale Ale_)
[Boxing Rock:](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) _Hunky Dory Pale Ale_, _Temptation Red_, and _The Vicar's Cross Double IPA
_[Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/): _Honey Lavender_ (also to be released soon in bottles at the brewery and private stores) will be available at all sessions
[Granite Brewery](http://www.granitebreweryhalifax.ca/): _Peculiar_ and _Best Bitter Special_
[Hell Bay Brewing](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/), [Meander River Farm and Brewery](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/), [PEI Brewing](http://peibrewingcompany.com/), and [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) are also sending casks, but we were unable to find out which beers.

So, what about the rest of the beer offerings?

Folks will also be able to enjoy beer from handful of other breweries from the Maritimes, including:

Garrison: _Tall Ship Amber_, _Irish Red Ale_, _Nut Brown Ale_, _Raspberry Wheat Ale_, _Hopyard Pale Ale_, _India Pale Ale_, _Imperial IPA_, and _NiT WiT Belgian Wheat

_[Picaroons](http://www.picaroons.ca/): _Best Bitter, Melonhead Watermelon Wheat, Blonde, Yippee IPA, _and a cask of_ Best Bitter
_[Pumphouse Brewery](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/):_ 1516 Premium Lager, Blueberry Ale, Cadian Ale, I.P.A., Premium Pilsner, 4 Alarm IPA_, and _Fire Chief Red
_[Rare Bird Brewing](http://www.rarebirdbeer.com/): _Maple Ale, Pale Ale, Full Steam Stout,_ and _Pumpkin Ale
_[Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/): _Fathom IPA, Deadwood Wheat, Big Water Brown, Balticus,_ and _Jacktar Stout
_[Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) (Saturday sessions only):_ Hippie Dippie Ale_ and _Butcher's Block Red
_

Unfortunately, many of our other favourite Maritime breweries will not be taking part (beyond the Cask Pavillion or at all). Those we reached for comment mentioned being already pushed beyond capacity with regular business, and were unable to dedicate product to be given away without being reimbursed.

There's beer from other parts of the world, though, to keep you satisfied! The Gluten-free options have expanded again this year, with the famed _IPA_ (and also tasty _American Pale Ale_) from [Glutenberg](https://glutenberg.ca/en) being poured, along with their regular offerings available in the NSLC. There are plenty of ciders, including the [Bulwark](http://www.bulwarkcider.com/) _Original_ and _Blush_, and [Stutz](http://www.stutzcider.com/) Cider and [Shipbuilders](http://www.shipbuilderscider.ca/) Cider (Saturday only), and several from Ireland. Speaking of Ireland, there will a be a strong showing from that country, with over 30 beers and ciders being poured by Irish breweries. There will also be a strong Quebec, Ontario, and Maine component again this year. Check the [list on the Fest site](http://seaportbeerfest.com/breweries) for the full details, use this [Map](http://seaportbeerfest.com/sites/default/files/SitePlan_11x17.pdf) to plan your attack.

There are a few [VIP tickets available](http://seaportbeerfest.com/tickets) for the Saturday afternoon session as well. These will allow you a special tasting glass and bottle opener, and to take part in a guided tasting and chat with some special guests,  [Nicholas Pashley](https://twitter.com/NotesOnABeermat) (author of _Notes on a Beermat: Drinking and Why it's Necessary_ and _Cheers: An Intemperate History of Beer in Canada_), Stephen Clinch (co-founder and co-owner of [Trouble Brewing](http://troublebrewing.ie/)), and [Craig Pinhey](http://www.frogspad.ca/) (local wine, beer and spirits writer).

Finally, in addition to staying hydrated, you've got to keep your belly full, right? Three vendors will be onsite to keep you satisfied, with lots of options, all for under $5.

The [Waterfront Warehouse](http://www.waterfrontwarehouse.ca/) will be bringing:
Fish & Chips
Duo of Oysters (gluten-free)

Beerfest co-founder Bruce Mansour and chef Tyler Smith of The Stubborn Goat also appeared on the [Global Morning News](http://globalnews.ca/video/1491657/food-to-pair-with-beer) to chat beer and food.

The [weather for the weekend](http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/canada/nova-scotia/halifax) doesn't look too fantastic, but fear not, the festival is indoors, at the [Cunard Centre](http://www.rcr.ca/catering/venues/cunard-centre/) at Pier 23.

Tickets are available for a few more hours at NSLCs across the city until the end of today, and [online](http://seaportbeerfest.com/tickets). Any tickets left over will also be available at the Cunard Centre box office beginning at noon Friday, but we wouldn't suggest waiting that long to snag some. Tickets for designated drivers and group tickets are also available.
