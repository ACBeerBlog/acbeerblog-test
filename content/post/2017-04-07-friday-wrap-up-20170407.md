Good morning, and welcome to another Friday... as usual, chock-full of news on beer releases, events, and more! Let's skip the chit chat and dive right in:

• It's another week, which means at least one new [2 Crows](http://2crowsbrewing.com/) beer is being released! Tomorrow at noon, they'll be tapping _Sunny Days_, a "Sunflower seed Brett Saison". Brewed with home-malted sunflower seeds (which made up 20% of the grist) as well as Pilsner, Vienna, Acid, and Wheat malts, the beer was fermented with a combination of _Brettanomyces bruxellensis_ and a "funky Saison yeast", bringing it to 7.1% ABV (and hopped to 27 IBUs). We're not sure what exactly to expect with this one, but as usual for many 2 Crows special releases, you can't deny that it sounds interesting! There'll only be one keg of this beauty pouring, so get down to the taproom to give it a try. In addition, two kegs of a new, "slightly spicier" batch of _Lil' Miguel_ Aztec Stout will be tapped next Friday (April 14th), followed by a keg of _Crosswired_ - a beer fermented with a mixture of a "wild" yeast strain and a wine yeast strain - on Thursday, April 20th; look for some _Crosswired_ to also appear at the [2 Crows Battery Park Tap Takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/183891668784561/) on April 13th.

• This week in Smith’s Cove, [Lazy Bear Brewing](http://www.lazybearbrewing.ca/) made two new brews available. The _Folly_ IPA with wild yeast that we wrote about two weeks ago has finally meandered its way through the system and was released last night at the brewery during their weekly growler night. This tropical fruity delight may not make it to the city so you’ll have to head down to the brewery or catch it at the [Annapolis Farmers and Traders Market](http://www.annapolisroyalfarmersmarket.com/) or one of the brewery’s regular tap accounts. Earlier in the week, as they waited for the _Folly_ to finish, _The Once-Over_ was released. This is a version of their _Bear Bones_ IPA that was different enough to justify a new moniker. Still brewed with **Wild Turkey** hops from Ontario, this 5.9% ABV brew was dry-hopped with that variety along with classic American **Cascade** and **Chinook** that are sure to bring citrus and pine to the aroma. Like the _Folly_, this one is available in the usual places, but some apparently also made its way to [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) in Dartmouth, so keep your eyes out for it to appear there.

• [Mill Street Brewpub](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) in St. John's has been busy, with a few new beers on tap now, or coming very soon._ Lukey's Bock_ is a traditional-style German Helles/Mai Bock, meaning light in colour with Munich malt-derived sweetness and aromatics. Named after the ship in the harbour of the same name, the 6.5% ABV Bock is on tap at their Mill Street/Bier Markt location only. Coming very soon from them is _Right Off the Hop_, a SMaSH (Single Malt and Single Hop) featuring **El Dorado** hops. This Double IPA took more than 6 kilograms of hops in their 8 hL system, for big bitterness and a massive pineapple aroma and flavour.

• Debuting next Wednesday, **April 12**, is a collaboration that Mill Street did with the [Port Rexton Brewing](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) Crew. Planned months ago during a trip to Port Rexton, and brewed in mid-March when PR made the return trip, the cross-province _Dunkelweizen_ will be launched in a big way. At 5.2% ABV, 22 IBUs, the Dark German Wheat beer features the iconic banans and clove aromatics, reminiscent of banana bread. The debut is a ticketed event, which gets you a pint of Port Rexton new IPA, a pint of Mill Street's _Black Bart's_, plus a celebratory pint of their collaboration. A Mac & Cheese bar, featuring the wares of St. John's own [Five Brothers Cheese](http://fivebrotherscheese.com/), will be set up to keep your stomach from growling, and going all night. Tickets are available by phone (709-383-7070), and are selling quickly, so be sure to grab them today!

• Fredericton's [Graystone Brewing](http://graystonebrewing.com/) recently launched their second Lager, an India Pale Lager named _Alpen IPL_. Described by the brewery as an "earthy, amber IPL with amble bitterness and a clean, soft mouthfeel", the grist contains Crystal and Munich malt to achieve the beer's colour and malt character. Hopped with **Columbus** and **Centennial** to 70 IBUs, it was fermented with a dry German Lager yeast, and then lagered at cool temperatures for 5 weeks before packaging. Coming in at 6% ABV, it's on tap now at the brewery for pints and growlers/crowlers, and is likely showing up at licensees across the city.

• Sticking with Fredericton beers, [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) released their _Porter_ a couple nights ago, a one-off that will only be available on tap at the brewery's tasting room for the first week. Sessionable at only 4.7% ABV, it shows off some roast and chocolate character, with a medium-bodied mouthfeel and a dry, slightly bitter finish from the use of dark malts. Look for it to pop up around New Brunswick for next weekend's [ANBL growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) program. And be sure to grab some cans of _Luster_, which has just returned and is as fresh as you can get it right now!

• And not to be left out, [Maybee Brewing](http://www.maybeebrew.com/) also has a new beer available! _Tailwind_ is a "New England Session IPA" (read: cloudy/hazy with big hop aromas and flavours, but not big bitterness) that was hopped heavily with **Mosaic**, as well as additions of **Amarillo**, **Cascade**, and **Chinook**. Fermented with a Vermont Ale strain from [Escarpment Labs](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/) to give even more tropical, citrusy, stone fruit characteristics, it all comes together in a highly drinkable 4.8% ABV, 45 IBUs package. And speaking of packaging, it's available now in 16 oz cans at the brewery (and soon at other brewery stores in NB), and on tap at Maybee accounts.

• And even more Fredericton news, as [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) is releasing a very special cider next week. They've "carefully chosen the best apples New Brunswick has to offer," including their favourite heritage Russet and Crab apples, to bring a very limited, 400 bottle production of _Orchard Reserve 2016_. An English Extra Dry cider that clocks in at 7.2% ABV, this one involved a slow fermentation process, followed by an additional 6 months of aging, enhancing the "subtle spice and delicate honey notes". These 750 mL bottles ($16.50 each) will be sold only at the Ciderhouse and participating Farmers' Markets, so be sure to grab a couple before they're gone! They'll be officially released next Wednesday at noon.

• Halifax's [Tidehouse Brewing](http://facebook.com/tidehousebrewingcompany/) should have a brand new one-off popping up today or through the weekend, a Saison named _Pied de Lapin_. Described by the brewery as a dry, "French/Belgian Saison", it was hopped predominantly with **Wakatu** (WHACK-a-tu? wah-KA-tu?), a New Zealand variety, as well as some **Centennial**. The Wakatu comes through with "prominent notes of lime zest, backed by subtle melon". Highly drinkable at 5.6% ABV, look for it on tap at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) and [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/), as well as available for growler fills at the brewery retail store, and [Halifax Forum Farmers Market](http://forumfarmersmarket.ca/).

• In Saint John, [Loyalist City](http://loyalistcitybrewing.ca/) is bringing out a new beer in their One Hop Series, but let us know there’s been some changes to the recipe for that series. First, they’ve found a supplier for the yeast made famous by John Kimmich’s [Alchemist Brewery](https://alchemistbeer.com/) in Vermont and have decided to ferment all their One Hop beers with it. Known in brewing circles as **Conan**, this yeast is known for producing an ester profile featuring stone fruit and light citrus notes that is very complimentary to modern American and New World hop varieties. It’s also known for producing a hazy final product consistent with the New England IPA style. Second, they’ve tweaked the recipe to give the beer a little more body and increased hop flavour and aroma. The first beer to be made with the new recipe is _Summer_ named, as always, after the single hop used in producing it. **Summer** hops are an Australian variety known for imparting citrus and stone fruit flavours and aromas. Look for melon and apricot on the nose and for the hops and yeast to complement each other nicely. Summer comes in at 5.5% ABV and 65 IBU. It will be available at the [Cask & Kettle](http://www.caskandkettle.com/) and other local tap accounts this week.

• Loyalist City has also released another new brew, _Württemberg Weissbier_. A classic German Hefeweizen, this cloudy, light golden, refreshing ale was brewed with 100% German malt, hops, and yeast. The Wheat and Pilsner malt enjoyed a three-part step mash (three temperature rests) to increase the development of banana and clove flavours expected in the style, which are also produced during fermentation from the Weizen yeast strain. Brewed with soft water in an attempt to replicate the low-mineral-content water of Plzeň, Germany, the resulting 5% ABV beer features a "pleasing banana-clove aroma that is complemented by a moderate bready malt flavour". And for you history buffs, the beer is named after Württemberg, the historical German territory that was home to the majority of the German-Canadian settlers that helped to colonize the Atlantic Canadian provinces. This highly-carbonated beer should be available now at your favourite LC tap account, and is also at select ANBL growler stations this weekend (check out which ones [here](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf)).

• In Dartmouth, [Spindrift](http://www.spindriftbrewing.com) released their highly anticipated _Barrel O’ Cherries_ this week. Winner of the Gold Medal at the DownEast Brewing Awards in Fredericton last month in the Experimental Beer category, this is their _Abyss_ dark lager that was aged in red wine barrels for 12 months and then racked onto sour cherries for further aging before being bottled with help from [North Brewing](http://northbrewing.ca/) and their bottler. Those who tasted it at the Fredericton Craft Beer Fest or the Savour Food & Wine Festival Craft Beer Cottage Party in Halifax have the inside scoop on this one. At 4.5% ABV it’s not a heavy hitter, but flavour wise you’ll taste big cherry notes married to bold chocolatey and roasty dark malt flavours. Some have likened the overall character to that of a Black Forest Cake. This is a limited edition beer with only 78 cases produced, and you can only get it at the brewery in Burnside.

• Acadie-Broue has brought back a blast-from-the-past, recently releasing _La Boloxée_, best described as a dark Saison. Brewer Patrice Godin took the base of his _Tintamarre_ Saison and darkened it by steeping a large amount of Midnight Wheat malt, to "stain" the wort. This gives a minimal roast character in the finish, while preserving the Farmhouse flavours of orange and pepper. Expect this beer to finish extremely dry, as a longer-than-usual fermentation brought the final gravity all the way down to 1.000, a reading usually reserved for ciders! The final numbers are 6.6% ABV and 30 IBUs. It's currently on tap at Le Coude, [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/theJamesJoycePubFredericton/), and should pop up at [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/), if it isn't on already.

**As always, there's plenty of beer-related events going on in our region; here's a few you should be paying particular attention to:**

• The annual [Saint John Beer Fest](http://www.saintjohnbeerfest.com/) is **tomorrow, April 8th**; while tickets are sold out, you can add your name to the [waiting list here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/saint-john-beerfest-2017-tickets-29607005350?aff=erelexpmlt), just in case! In the meantime, those of you lucky enough to currently have tickets can check out the [full beer list here](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest/posts/1254917231258361), and plan your attack! Plenty of beer and cider will be pouring, including a few special releases.

• Leading into the Saint John Beer Fest tomorrow, [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) will be taking over the taps this evening starting at 5:00 pm at [McGill’s](https://www.mcgillssj.com/). Pints will be $5 all night, with 8 PEIBC brews on the go, including some new ones. Look for _Big Don Belgian Coffee Blonde_, _Tasman Pale Ale_ and _Black Lager_ in particular along with some Gahan faves. And if you miss that, rest assured that PEIBC will be in full effect at the beer fest on Saturday.​

• Since opening their doors in July of 2016, [Port Rexton Brewing Co.](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) has been inundated with emails and calls asking, “How do I start a brewery in Newfoundland?” In response, they’ve decided to take the amazingly forthcoming step of hosting an open house/open books event on **April 14th and 15th**. On Friday night there will be a social at the brewery from 1800 - 2200h. Saturday will feature a brewday, with mash in commencing promptly at 0700h after which Port Rexton will open their books and their database to answer as many questions as they can from the group, likely ending around 1400h. On the table are questions about the NLC, suppliers, equipment, funding opportunities, regulatory considerations and provincial requirements. It’s no secret that Newfoundland is a very difficult place to open a brewery and this outreach to the brewing community by Port Rexton less than a year into their operations is commendable. So if you’re very serious about opening a brewery in NL and actively working towards that goal, and you’re interested in hearing from some folks who’ve managed to do it, you can email beer@portrextonbrewing.com to register. Space is limited.

• The [Brewnettes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/769722406415310/), a Ladies Beer League in Newfoundland, has scheduled their April event, a Pizza Party on **Thursday, April 20th**. The event will take place at [Quidi Vidi Brewery](http://www.quidividibrewery.ca/) in St. John’s and will consist of a brewery tour at 1830h, a tasting at 1900h and finally pizza at 2000h. It’s $15 to attend, and you’ll want to check in on the event’s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1742431706068924/) to show your interest. After the highly successful axe-throwing event in March, this is sure to be a blast for everyone involved.

• Not content to limit themselves to the Dark Side of the harbour with their tap takeover at [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) next week, [2 Crows](https://www.2crowsbrewing.com/) will aim for total HRM domination by following that up with [another takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/1039778929455236/) a week later at the [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/)! On **Friday, April 21st**, starting at 1900h, you’ll find 8-10 2 Crows beers on tap at the Goat with samples and a special price on flights. No cover and live music round out the package. Buy a flight and you’ll receive a ballot to win tickets to the **2 Crows Brewer’s Brunch**. “Brewer’s Brunch?” you ask? Yes, the very next day, **Saturday, April 22**, from 1300-1500h, you’ll find _another_ 2 Crows event at the Goat where Jeremy Taylor will prove he’s not actually chained to his mash tun by making an appearance. Tickets are $39 per person and entitle you to four 12oz beers, each a 2 Crows offering that’s been paired with a course from the kitchen. You can see which beers and the food they’ve each been paired with on the event’s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/128166884386388/). Space is limited, so if you’re interested you’ll want to email tyler@stubborngoat.ca.

• In [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) news, they've got another premium European tap takeover in the works for **April 22** that's got fans of forward-thinking beers all a-titter. [To Øl](http://to-ol.dk/) is a gypsy brewery from Denmark. Started by students of Mikkel Borg Bjergsø of [Mikkeller](http://mikkeller.dk/) (not just beer-wise, he taught them in high school!), Tobias Emil Jensen and Tore Gynther started brewing with their Bjergsø in their school's kitchen (high school is different in Europe, apparently) in 2005. While he moved on to start Mikkeller, they continued to hone their brewing craft before opening their own brewery in 2010. In addition to their beer, they've got Scandinavian brewpubs [BRUS](https://twitter.com/BRUS_Cph) in Copenhagen, the recently-opened [BRUS Bar Oslo](https://www.facebook.com/BRUSbarOslo/), and, with Mikkeller, are part of the group behind the lambic-focused [Koelschip](https://www.facebook.com/Koelschip-773572126107862/). To quote the gang at Stillwell, "Quality is guaranteed, mind-expansion highly likely." From Brett-aged Table Beer, Dry-hopped Sours, Gose, to Barrel-Aged Saison and Imperial Coffee Stouts, there is something for everyone pouring on the 22nd. If you liked the Mikkeller takeovers in December and January or are sad you missed them, this is another chance to drink on the leading edge of beermaking.

• It's too late if you don't already have a ticket, but [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) is hosting a **Tastes of the World** event on **Sunday, April 23**. Hosted by **Stephen Beaumont**, author or co-author of ten books, including _The World Atlas of Beer_, two editions of _The Great Canadian Beer Guide_, and _The Beer & Food Companion_, it will be a guided tasting of eight of the world's best beers, several of which have never been available in NS. Four of the beers will be paired with thoughtfully selected cheeses. As you sip and munch, Mr. Beaumont will provide tasting notes, some history about the beers, and details on how they were made. Tickets <del>are</del> were $36.50 each - they sold out extremely quickly. If you didn't get one, but wish you had, maybe let the fine folks at Stillwell know; perhaps if enough additional interest is shown we'll see another such event scheduled (can you tell none of us acted quickly enough to get tickets?). The good news for those who are missing out on the tasting is that some of the beers that will be served (including Stilly's last keg of Nectarous from [Four Winds Brewing](http://www.fourwindsbrewing.ca/)) will be available after the event. And a few new-to-the-province bottles will hit the fridge that day, _Blond d'Esquelbeq_ from [Brasserie Thiriez](http://www.brasseriethiriez.com/) and [Brasserie de la Senne](http://brasseriedelasenne.be/) _Taras Boulba_, classics in the Saison style.

• [Garrison](http://garrisonbrewing.com) will be co-hosting a Brew and Bites Dinner with [Harbourstone Sea Grill & Pour House](http://www.marriott.com/hotel-restaurants/yhzmc-halifax-marriott-harbourfront-hotel/harbourstone/5470933/home-page.mi) on Thursday, **April 27.** It will feature an IPA tasting menu that pairs 5 courses from Executive Chef **Trevor Simms** with beers from Brewmaster **Daniel Girard**. Tickets are $55 and can be reserved by calling 902.428.7852 or emailing harbourstone@marriott.com. You can see details on the food and beers in [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSeEKApAzMp/) on Garrison's Instagram.

**A few more things today:**

- The ANBL has expanded their [Growler Program](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) further recently. When opening their new location at Corbett Centre in Fredericton (after closing the Prospect Street location), they upraded to 4 taps. The ANBL in Newcastle now features a growler station as well.
- [Flying Boats ](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710)is releasing their _Stagecoach_ Amber Ale just in time for this weekend's Saint John Beer Fest. This collaboration with [Craig Pinhey](http://frogspad.ca/) features strong caramel and raisin/dark fruit characteristics from the malts, and was bittered using NB-grown **Cascade**. The 5.5% ABV and 29 IBUs brew is available at the Shediac Beach brewery's local accounts as well as at the Fest.
- [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) is looking for the cutest, smartest, or most distinct cat to once again grace the label of their _MelonHead_ Watermelon Wheat beer. Submissions are open until May 2nd, with all of the details available [here](http://picaroons.ca/we-need-your-cat/).
- Mahone Bay's [Saltbox Brewing](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) released _The Loyalist_, a beer they are describing as a "Yorkshire Olde Ale". At 6.7% ABV, it has notes of biscuit and light herbaceous qualities from the traditional **Fuggles** hops used in the boil. Fermented with Nottingham for a dry finish.
