Happy Friday, everyone! We don't want to jinx anything, but it's beginning to look more like spring in our region. To celebrate, grab a pint of beer (or coffee if your employer frowns on drinking on the job), and let's get right to the beer news:

• In Saint John, [Big Tide Brewing](http://bigtidebrew.com/) is pouring a new beer at their brewpub. The beer is _Three Pages to the Wind_, a "Whiskey Pale Ale". Brewed with Pale Ale and Smoked malt, the beer is mildly hopped with both Cascade and Willamette hops, with whiskey added during the conditioning stage; it comes in at about 5.2% ABV. They're also pouring a couple of returning beers, including _Nut Brown_, a 4.8% ABV [Southern English Brown](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style11.php#1b) that employs some Chocolate malt, and _Crasberry Cream Ale_, a 5% ABV [Cream Ale](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style06.php#1a) that has cranberry and raspberry juice added during conditioning.

• [Red Rover Brewing](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) is expanding their on-tap distribution in Fredericton, with their _Summer Brew_ now available at the [Grad House](http://www.clubzone.com/c/49404/the-grad-house-fredericton) on the UNB campus, and _Spring Brew_ on tap at [Isaac's Way](http://isaacsway.ca/). Of course, their Summer is also still available at the King Street Ale House. Owner/brewer Adam Clawson has also designed some new tap handles for their ciders, which have been [3D printed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) to give varying results for each of the three ciders they have available. Very cool!

• [Gahan House](http://www.gahan.ca/) in Charlottetown is hosting the finale of their **Homebrewer's Challenge** tomorrow 2-4pm, and we're all invited! Narrowed down from 16 entries to 5, the final judging will take place that afternoon, courtesy of a panel of six beer lovers, including current and former brewers from Gahan and [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/), judging these beers on Flavour Characteristics, Off Flavours, Appearance, General taste, Creativity and Overall balance. The brewers are hoping to win the big prize, having a chance to brew their beer on Gahan's system, and have it served right at the bar! There will be live music and entertainment courtesy of Iain MacCarvill, and appetizers passed around. Of course, the full restaurant and bar will be open as well. Be sure to drop by and cheer on these well-deserving finalists (and all other entrants). Well done, all! We'll be sure to pass along details of the event and winning beer next week.

• In other Gahan news, they released their _Honey Brown Ale_ this week. It is a blend of the _Sir John A's Honey Wheat_ (featuring local PEI honey) and _Iron Bridge Brown_, and weighs in at 4.8%ABV. It will be available on tap and in bottles at the Gahan House Brewpub, the [PEILCC](http://www.peilcc.ca/) and select [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/location.html?upc=878364000246+&submit.x=36&submit.y=15) locations.

• Good news, Sackville, NB! Your craft beer availability has taken a step up, as [Celtic Knot](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) beer will soon be on tap at [Ducky's](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar). Management at Ducky's has confirmed that they will be expanding their draught selection from 14 to 22 taps, with mostly local craft beer being served! Following this expansion (hopefully within the next 1-2 weeks), one or two taps will be devoted to Celtic Knot's beers... other local nanobreweries are likely to be added in the near future.

• If you haven't been visiting [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) for the **Wednesday Firkins** lately, you've been missing out! Over the past two weeks, Brewmaster [Greg Nash](https://twitter.com/__NASH__) has been serving up dry-hopped, cask-conditioned versions of his upcoming _Thulsa Doom Double IPA_, first with Simcoe, and more recently with Citra. Both of these were excellent beers, selling out that night. This base beer weighs in at 7.8%ABV, but there is no hint of alcohol at all, as it features a wonderful citrus and fruit hop aroma and flavour, calculated at 130 IBU, thanks to generous amounts of Columbus, Simcoe, Centennial and Chinook. The yeast used to ferment this brew is called Conan, and also gives off apricot and citrus characteristics. Look for it on tap the middle of next week! Brewmaster Nash also gave us a preview of next week's Firkin: a [SMaSH](http://www.brewersfriend.com/2009/09/05/what-is-smash-brewing/) Lager, featuring Galaxy hops. Be sure to drop by right at 4pm, to be sure you don't miss out!

• In other Rockbottom news, be sure to check out their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8qN35UdmNcEpMdRl7SWLbw/videos), to get the inside scoop on upcoming specials, events, and beers. We see that a member of the Ladies Beer League dropped by this week to assist with the brewing (and cleaning) of an upcoming batch of _Fathom IPA_.

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) has officially announced plans for their _Dooryard_ launch - it will be held on Earth Day, Tuesday April 22nd at the [York St. Train Station](http://www.nbliquor.com/station.html) in Fredericton. From 4:00 - 7:00 pm, they will be pouring samples of Dooryard, their spring/summer seasonal brewed with coriander and orange peel; there will also be wood-fired "Dough'yard" pizza from [Real Food Connections](https://www.facebook.com/Realfoodconnections) and [Speerville Flour Mill](http://www.speervilleflourmill.ca/), and live entertainment with [Earthbound Trio](https://www.facebook.com/earthboundtrio).

• In other Picaroons news, they've announced that they will be brewing a collaboration beer with Toronto's [Great Lakes Brewery](http://www.greatlakesbeer.com/) in the near future. While details on on the beer are currently being kept secret, we can confirm that the beer will be ready in time for the 2014 [Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/), which are being held May 29th-31st in Fredericton. Both Picaroons and Great Lakes have won the Brewery of the Year award in the past (2011 and 2013, respectively), so we're naturally expecting great things from their collaboration!

• [North Brewing's](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) _Farmhouse  Ale_ is back again. Weighing in at 7.5%, it features a candied fruit aroma, and tart flavour, thanks to the combination of yeast choice, and wheat and raw sugar in the malt bill. Available at the brewery on Agricola Street, and will be on tap around the city shortly. Their second release of the _Glenora-barrel-aged Strong Dark_ is down to the last few bottles, so be sure to drop by the brewery today to grab one!

• [Bad Apple Brewhouse's](https://www.facebook.com/badapplebrewhouse) _Russian Imperial Stout_ is back in stock in Somerset. Weighing in at 9%ABV, it is a big beer with big flavour, thanks to loads of roast malt and generous hopping. It is available in 1.89L and 750mL refillables, along with their _American Pale Ale_ and _Cider_. Look out for the Barrel-aged RIS coming out at the end of the month, as well as a few more new brews. And a quick note for locals looking to have a pint of their APA at [The Wick Pub](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Union-Street-Cafe-and-the-Wick-Pub/58316312942) in Berwick, they are now fully stocked. But be warned, their first keg was emptied in one night last week!

• Halifax Beer Fans: As if you didn't need another excuse to visit [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/), they will be tapping three beers from [Bellwoods Brewery](http://bellwoodsbrewery.com/) Sunday at noon. _Witchshark IIPA_, _Grizzly Beer American Brown Ale_, and _Farmhouse Classic. _See you there!

• In celebration of the anniversary of Prohibition Repeal in New Brunswick, there's a beer cocktail event being held at the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) next Saturday, April 19th. From 3:00 - 5:00 pm, they will be mixing up a variety of beer and whisky cocktails "inspired by the drinks and era of prohibition"; tickets are priced accordingly at $19.27 and can be purchased [online](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/prohibition-repeal-cocktail-tasting-at-the-king-street-ale-house-tickets-7154508327). No Tommy guns, please.

• A reminder that the [Burgers n' Beer](https://www.facebook.com/events/478530042248445/) event at [reLiSH](http://relishyou.ca/) in Fredericton is this coming Tuesday, April 15th. There are a FEW [tickets](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/burgers-n-beer-fredericton-tickets-10969188137) still available; remember, if you live in Fredericton, it's your first chance to try Celtic Knot's _Dubh Loki_ (a Black IPA) and [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery)'s _Red Coat India Red Ale_! Not to mention some Red Rover cider and beer from [Grimross Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307)... and burgers! More detail in our post [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/friday-wrap-up-4/). Hope to see you there!

• Finally, be sure to drop by Stillwell Thursday evening, for the release of the [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) & [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) beer, _Alewife's Revenge_. The LBL crew visited Boxing Rock on March 15th and brewed up this beer featuring local cranberries and orange zest, and now it's ready for prime time! Check out some [pictures from the brewday](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/?p=217) to whet your appetite. If you can't make it down for the release party, look for it in growlers and bottles at the brewery, [Seaport Farmers Market](http://www.halifaxfarmersmarket.com/), and the private wine stores in Halifax.
