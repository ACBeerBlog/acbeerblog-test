Happy Friday, everyone! How about some beer news for this week?

• [Boxing Rock Brewery](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) in Shelburne is opening Saturday! At their location at [78 Ohio Rd](http://www.boxingrock.ca/contact), they will have their Temptation Red Ale in 1 L and 1.89 L growlers, as well as some merchandise. The storefront will be open Monday-Saturday, and there will be a grand opening soon. They will also be at the [Shelburne Farmer's Market](https://www.facebook.com/ShelburneFarmersMarket) tomorrow. Welcome to the fast growing Atlantic Canada Beer scene!

• [Railcar Brewing Company](http://www.railcarbrewing.com/), set to open late this fall, will no longer be housed in Railcar 3 at the [Shogomac Site](http://www.florencevillebristol.ca/html/shogomoc.html) in Florenceville-Bristol, NB, despite a previous proposal being accepted by the town. Owner/brewmaster Mitch Biggar has posted on Railcar's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/railcarbrewing/) that he is currently weighing other location options for the brewery. We'll be sure to post on this nano-brewery's new location and plans as soon as we can!

• [Propeller Brewing Co](http://drinkpropeller.ca/) is opening their Dartmouth storefront at 617 Windmill tomorrow. They will have growlers and bottles for sale, and their 16th Anniversary celebration beer should be available at both stores. It is an unfiltered dry-hopped Pale Ale. Eventually, the main production will switch over to the larger 30hL brewhouse in Dartmouth, but like all good things, it's not going to happen overnight! We hope to have more details for you soon.

• Looking to attend the [Brewer's Bash](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) in Fredericton, hosted by [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons), next Saturday, July 13th? Well, tickets have been sold out for some time, but organizers are still looking for volunteers to help out with pouring samples, tending the entrance and exits, running beer and ice, and keeping the site tidy. There are two options: one 4-hour shift in the morning or afternoon, and one 5&1/2 hour shift in the evening. Volunteers would have access to the festival after their shift is completed; while evening volunteers would obviously miss most of the festival, there will be a "post-event bonus" of some sort. If you're interested, send an email ASAP to kim@picaroons.ca.

• On July 1st, shortly after our post in last Friday's Wrap-Up, [Grimross Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) began selling their Cheval D'Or at the Picaroons Brewtique in Fredericton. The 5 bbl batch (155 U.S. gallons) of this Saison was also brewed at this location, and is available in 750 mL swing-top growlers. Those living in Fredericton will be seeing this beer on tap at restaurants and bars in the near future, along with some other Belgian-style beers that owner/brewer Stephen Dixon has planned.

• For those of you that haven't yet purchased your tickets for August's [Fredericton Beer Run](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/fredericton-beer-run-to-be-held-this-summer/), here's another incentive for you: one of the prizes for this event will be a private tasting of some of [Red Rover Brewing](http://www.redroverbrew.com/)'s ciders. This will be just one of the craft-beer/cider related prizes available, ranging from random draws to swag and other items for the top runners in each distance.

• [Shiretown](https://www.facebook.com/shiretown) continues to expand the locations that their Blonde du Quai can be found. Check the [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/location.html?upc=400000024493+&submit.x=19&submit.y=14) site for exact details, but it can now be found regularly in some stores in Fredericton and Moncton, as well as Caraquet and Tracadie-Sheila, and on tap at good beer bars [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Laundromat-Expresso-Bar/133734576637538) and the [Saint John Ale House](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnAleHouse).

That's it for this week. Be sure to enjoy the warm weather with some local and cold (but not too cold!) craft beer!
