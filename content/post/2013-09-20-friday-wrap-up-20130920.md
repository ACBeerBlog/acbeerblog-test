Welcome to the last Friday of the summer of 2013. It seems like just yesterday that we were kicking off the beer festival season, and announcing the patios opening. But fear not, fearless Atlantic Canadian reader, there is plenty of great beer news and information to guide us into the fall of 2013!

• Details are few, but this week [Yellowbelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St. John's brewed up another batch of their Republic Pale Ale using locally-grown hops. If it's anything like previous year's beer, it will be about 6% ABV, and feature a big citrus and pine nose from the hearty Newfoundland hops.

• [Shiretown Beer](https://www.facebook.com/shiretown) in Charlo has also brewed up a beer with fresh hops, these being some wild hops from Charlo. They brewed up "Runnin' Down the Road" Amber Ale, and the local hops will give it a spicy aroma, and plenty of bitterness. It will be available in a few weeks. Their Big Brown Ale and Buckwheat Honey Ale are both currently available at the brewery, as well as their flagship Blonde du Quai. And their expansion into bars and [ANBLs](http://www.nbliquor.com/location.html?upc=400000024493+&submit.x=27&submit.y=12) across the province continues, with more and more stores being added all of the time.  Fredericton, Moncton, Sackville, the list continues to grow.

• [BarNone Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) in PEI will soon be releasing their first IPA since a brief appearance at the PEI Beer Festival two years ago. An unfiltered American IPA, it comes in at 6.5% ABV and is heavily-hopped, both in the kettle and with multiple dry-hop additions, according to brewer/owner Don Campbell. Showcasing several "sought-after" hop varieties, the beer should be available for growler fills at the brewery (every Thursday from 6-8 pm) soon. To keep updated on its release, follow Barnone on their [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/BARNONEBEER).

• BarNone will also be taking part in this weekend's [Kegs, Corks & Oysters](http://www.fallflavours.ca/calendar/56/4684-Kegs-Corks-Oysters) event at Credit Union Place ([511 Notre Dame St](https://www.google.ca/maps?q=511+Notre+Dame+St,+Summerside,+PE+C1N+1T2&sll=55.99999999999999,-96.00000000000001&sspn=40.64800078208306,76.7966161218369&t=m&hnear=511+Notre+Dame+St,+Summerside,+Prince+County,+Prince+Edward+Island+C1N+1T2&z=16)) in Summerside. Their beer will be used to cook and pair with famous Malpeque Oysters as part of this Fall Flavours Festival event. Tickets are $35 (+fees), available at [BoxOfficePEI](https://boxofficepei.com/venue/pei-fall-flavours-festival/show/2013-kegs-corks-oysters/performance/172596).


• We now have some details on this year’s Harvest Ale from [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons), which will be officially launched on Thursday, Sept. 26th. A Pale Ale that uses two-row base malt grown in New Brunswick, it also has a small percentage of Crystal malt which should add some caramel sweetness to the beer. As mentioned before, there will be different locally-grown hops used in each batch, coming from different farmers in Atlantic Canada; this should give each batch separate flavor and aroma profiles. According to Dennis Goodwin, Marketing Director at Picaroons, the farms providing the hops will be [Happy Hopyard](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Happy-Hopyard-Inc/188837294602006) in Cornhill, NB (showcasing Nugget, Centennial, Cascade, Goldings, and more),  Southern Farms in Wicklow, NB, [Wysmykal Farm](http://www.wysmykalfarm.ca/index.php) in Chapman Settlement, NS, and possibly more to be added later. By going to picaroons.ca/myharvest (the site will be active upon the beer's launch), you will be able to enter the batch number on your bottle's label to find out more information regarding your beer.







• The newest beer on tap at the Hart and Thistle in Halifax is the [Statutory IPA](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2013/09/statutory-ipa.html). Weighing in at 7.2% ABV and 52 IBUs, this is a juicy and malty IPA, brewed with Centennial, Cascade, and Columbus hops. It contrasts the [TubberRoe Robust Porter](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2013/09/tubberroe-robust-porter.html) nicely, whose flavours are reminiscent of dark chocolate and dark fruit.







• For fans of the [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/), and in beer in general, Brewmaster Greg Nash posted a [video of a recent brewday](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2013/09/video-tour-beer-in-making.html) for the [Broken Down Special Old Bitter](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2013/05/broken-down-sob-esb-now-on-tap.html). It's a behind-the-scenes view of what it takes to get from grain to glass at the Rockbottom. And remember that every Saturday at 1pm, Nash taps a special cask of beer, sometimes a different take on a current beer (blackened Fathom IPA), or a completely new one (last week's was the Deadwood Wheat refermented with 8oz of fresh ginger).







• This coming Wednesday, the 25th, Mike Buhler ([Certified Cicerone](https://cicerone.org/content/certified-cicerone) and co-director of the [Beerthief Newfoundland Craft Beer Order Club](http://www.beerthief.ca)) will be doing a guided tasting of six beers from the [Wychwood Brewery](http://www.wychwood.co.uk/#/movies//hobgoblin/beers/2). The event is at 7PM at [Bitters Restaurant and Lounge](http://bitters.gsumun.ca/) on the MUN campus (216 Prince Philip Drive). For $24, you will receive 100mL of each Wychwood beer, an appertif of Quidi Vidi or Yellowbelly beer, a burger, and chocolate brownie. Mike is a fount of beer knowledge, and lots of fun, so I'm sure the evening will be great. To take part, please reserve your seat by emailing [Tom Beckett](mailto:tom.beckett_at_nl.rogers.com).







Finally this week, big news from [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/)! They brewed their first batch of beer at their new Dartmouth location yesterday (617 Windmill Rd, their cold beer store has been open for a few months). It was, not surprisingly given Halifax's lust for hops, an IPA. We hope to get a look at the new digs soon, and will certainly do a full profile on their expanded system and location. In the meantime, be sure to look for their Nocturne Dark Lager out today, released in collaboration with the [Nocturne Art at Night](http://nocturnehalifax.ca/) event, taking place October 19th, 6pm-midnight around the HRM.
