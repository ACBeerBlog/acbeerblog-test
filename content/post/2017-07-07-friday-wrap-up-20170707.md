Hey, it's Friday again! Just when we were getting back into the groove after a three-day break, they decided to send another weekend our way, how about that! We've got brand new beers, and plenty of events to tell you about across our region, so grab your sandwich in one hand, your beer in the other, and scroll along with us today...

• Down in Lawrencetown in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, the gang at [Lunn’s Mill](https://www.lunnsmill.beer/) decided to do something special for their 50th batch. Reaching into their trove of favourite recipes, they came up with a double dry-hopped SMaSH beer featuring current darling of North American brewing **Mosaic** hops. Called _Canada Day SMaSH_ for the simple fact that it was released just in time for the big day last weekend, it leverages a new school technique for dry hopping, namely the addition of the first charge before the completion of primary fermentation, which helps to provide a “juicy” character. The result is a showcase of the hop, with tropical fruit followed by citrus and then a dank finish. There wasn’t a huge batch of it to begin with and it’s going fast, so if you want to get your hands on it you’ll have to get down there for a sample or a growler fill. That said, we’ve been advised that it might very well make another appearance in the future. Meanwhile, in other Lunn’s Mill news, they’re getting the paperwork together to allow for pouring full pints in their hospitality room, which should hopefully happen in the next few weeks. And their 5 BBL Brew-in-a-Conical is ramping up to full production, with a couple of batches already done, including _Charming Molly_. More beer brewed should mean more availability in other parts of the province.

• Southwestern Nova Scotia’s newest brewery, [Heritage Brewing Co](https://www.facebook.com/HeritageBrewingCo/) in Yarmouth also released a single hop beer for Canada Day, their _Citra Session IPA_. Cited as one of their own favourites in [our profile](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/06/15/heritage-brewing-yarmouth/) back in mid-June, it’s now available. Featuring the extremely citrusy **Citra** hop variety, this beer has just enough base and specialty malt to bring it up to 5% ABV and balance the flavour brought by hops. At 42 IBU it should have a firm, but not distracting bitterness, and dry-hopping should ensure that it’s got a healthy aroma. Grapefruit, melon, gooseberry, passionfruit and lychee are all represented in this easy-drinking summer quaffer. It’s definitely available at the brewery for growler fills and 4oz tasters; hopefully it will appear at tap accounts as well.

• Hopping across the Bay of Fundy finds us in Saint John, NB, where [Loyalist City Brewing](https://loyalistcitybrewing.ca) has released _Pink Dwarf_, the first of their "Summer Sour" series of beers. Brewed in the Berliner Weisse style with a German Wheat and Pilsner malt grist, it was soured with their own blend of four _Lactobacillus_ strains. _Pink Dwarf_ gets its name from the Dwarf Cherries used in the beer, giving it a lovely pink hue. The tartness of the cherries only serve to enhance the acidity of the _Lacto_, and provide the unfiltered beer with a sour cherry flavour and aroma. It is currently available at a couple of LCBC's accounts in Saint John, and on tap at the [ANBL growler*](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) stations in Saint John/KV and Fredericton this weekend, along with their _Wurttemberg Weissbier_. *The growler document is slow to update this week, double-check the date in case it's not been updated when you read this...

• Also in Saint John, [Big Tide Brewing](http://www.bigtidebrew.com/) has a very special ale on tap for the second time. Originally designed with **Gilliane Nadeau** of [Uncorked Tours](http://www.uncorkednb.com/) and her husband-to-be for their engagement party, a new batch has been brewed to celebrate the actual nuptials this weekend. _ALEtar MatrimoniALE_ was brewed in the Altbier style, with traditional Pilsner, Munich and Vienna malts, top-fermenting ale yeast, and hopped lightly with **Hallertau Magnum** and **Saazer** hops before being aged for 5 weeks. Light copper in colour, it comes in at 5.2% ABV and a light 20 IBU, smooth as the style goes and easy-drinking enough to be sessionable. Also on the board as of Canada Day is another summery fruit beer that they’re calling _Long Reach Strawberry Rhubarb Blonde_. Starting with a blonde ale recipe using 2-row and pale malts along with Libery hops to the tune of 20 IBU, they added over 60 lbs. of local rhubarb and strawberries. The result is a 5.4% ABV refreshing beer that walks a fine line between tart and sweet. As long as they last, you’ll find both of these beers available for pints in the taproom and growler fills to go.

• Heading up Highway 7 will get you to Fredericton, where [TrailWay Brewing](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) calls home. They have released a pair of new beers in the past seven days, so let's get you up to speed: Last Friday saw the release of _Adore_ Double IPA, a hazy, juicy, aromatic beer featuring plenty of late- and dry-hopping from **Amarillo**, **Citra**, **El Dorado**, and **Ella**. Smooth and supremely drinkable, despite its 8.0% ABV. Joining _Adore_ is the latest in Trailway's "Seeing" series, this time featuring **Ekuanot** (formerly known as **Equinox**). _Seeing Ekuanot_ is a 6.0% IPA, and for the first time, TW used [lupulin powder](https://ychhops.com/hop-products/cryo-hops) for half of the dry-hop. On hop cones, the resiny yellow powder are lupulin glands, containing the essential oils and Alpha and Beta acids that are the primary ingredients for which hops are so highly prized. Extraction of the lupulin powder brings out these positives, but without any of the plant material to get in the way. We couldn't say it any better than TrailWay, "The result is massive flavour and aroma without the vegetative and astringency that can be introduced when dryhopping at these rates with pellets or whole cone." Both of these beers are available now at their North Side taproom on tap for samples, pints, and growlers, and in cans (but in more limited fashion).

• Still in Fredericton, [Grimross Brewing](https://grimross.com/) has hopped (see what we did there) on the Summer Dad Beer trend with their new _Braunschweig German Pils_. Crystal clear and brilliant yellow, it weighs in at a lovely and light 4.5% ABV and features the complex flavour you'd expect from the style. Kegged yesterday, it is already available in the Grimross Taproom and should be making an appearance at the [Picaroons Brewtique](http://picaroons.ca/fill-a-growler/). And don’t worry if you don’t think you can pronounce Braunschweig, it’s just the German form of Brunswick!

• Heading back down to Saint John and environs, there are two breweries looking to complete their teams for their imminent opening/expansion. [Hammond River Brewery](http://hrbrewing.ca/) is hiring folks for their taproom in Rothesay at [141 Old Hampton Road](https://www.google.ca/search?q=141+Old+Hampton+Road%2C+Rothesay%2C+New+Brunswick+E2E+2N6&oq=141+Old+Hampton+Road%2C+Rothesay%2C+New+Brunswick+E2E+2N6&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=141+Old+Hampton+Road,+Rothesay,+New+Brunswick+E2E+2N6&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=45400609,-65977573,3&tbm=lcl&tbs=lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sEAE,lf:1,lf_ui:9) (adjacent to the Barrel's Head), which is slated to open next week (all signs point to <del>July 10th</del> later in the week). Contact them via [social](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery/) [media](http://www.twitter.com/HRBrewing) for more details.

• The second brewery is [Gahan House Port City](https://www.facebook.com/Gahan-House-Port-City-435098283541903/), which will soon be calling [87 Prince William St](https://goo.gl/maps/FGWn9AYh2Mn) home. They are hiring Assistant General Managers, a Head Chef and Sous Chefs. Check out their [Careers page](http://mhgpei.com/join-us/) and [email](mailto:sjcareers@mhgpei.com) for more information, and you can expect their location to open this fall.

• The three-bearded beer-banging beast known as [902 BrewCast](http://www.902brewcast.com/) dropped episode #17 last week, this time with **Chad Steeves** of Moncton’s [Tide & Boar Gastropub](http://www.tideandboar.com/) talking about craft beer, food, and operating their own brewery. Meanwhile, the boys hit the road this week to the South Shore to visit and record episodes with Bridgewater’s [Firkinstein](https://www.facebook.com/FirkinStein-Brewing-754150891380564/) and Shelburne’s [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/). So if you haven’t already, grab the T&B episode and give it a listen while you anticipate what’s coming down the pike this coming Nine-Oh-Tuesday.

• And speaking of Boxing Rock, word came out this week that the latest beers in their Barrel Aged series have arrived: _Barrel Aged Battery Rock_ and _Barrel Aged U-889_ made their debut this week after both spent some six months in barrels formerly used at [Ironworks Distillery](https://ironworksdistillery.com/) for their gold medal-winning _Bluenose Rum_. If you’ll recall, _Battery Rock_ was an India Brown Ale specially brewed in collaboration with [North Brewing](http://northbrewing.ca/) for Boxing Rock’s takeover of [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) back in November. What was already a big beer at 9% ABV is now a certified heavy-hitter at 11%. And if you’re worried you’ll miss the hops half a year later, fear not, as a new round of dry-hopping with **Citra** and **Huell Melon** took place between the barrel and the bottle. That said don’t expect the hops to express themselves as they would in a young beer. As for the U-889, it also saw a jump from 9% ABV (well, 8.89%, allegedly) to the 11% range after its time in the barrel. A bigger-bodied beer to begin with, expect the vanilla and coffee to have mellowed somewhat and melded with the wood and spirit character. And if you missed the first of BR’s Barrel series, the _Barrel Aged Triskaidekaphobia_ Brown Ale last April, it turns out there are a few of those left as well, now with a year of bottle aging to boot. If you’re interested in any of these beers, the only place we’re sure you can get them is at the brewery, but if we hear tell of them appearing at the private stores in Halifax or one or more of the province’s farmers markets we’ll be sure to let you know!

• Further up the South Shore, Mahone Bay’s [Saltbox Brewing Company](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) has a couple of beers in the works. The first is the return of their _Loyalist ESB_, a 5.9% ABV and 38 IBU beer that inhabits the upper end of the scale for English Bitters. It’s hopped with the classic English **Fuggle** hops and **Nottingham** yeast for a very traditional experience. They’re hoping to keg it tomorrow, so you should find it available in the coming week at the brewery for fills and pints, and later at tap accounts. Meanwhile they’re also putting the finishing touches on their _Rhubarb Berliner Weiss_, a 4.8% ABV beer that was soured with some 10 - 15 pounds of rhubarb along with _Lactobacillus_ in the fermenter. They’re hoping to have that one available early next week, also by the pint in the taproom and growler fills to go, but this one is also expected to see some distribution for growler stations in the private stores in Halifax. And if you’re looking for something delicious to go with that beer, Saltbox will also be welcoming [Backoos Korean Togo](https://www.facebook.com/Backoos/) for a [pop-up](http://static.ow.ly/docs/SaltBox-Backoos-POPUP%20POSTER_6wl8.pdf) tomorrow and Sunday.

• Things are swinging at [Horton Ridge Malt and Grain Co.](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) with the advent of their new on-site brewery and tap room. This week they had a new beer of their own pouring, the _Island Wheat_. Lightly hopped with **Mosaic** and **Azacca** for hints of tropical fruit and citrus, the wheat should make it a refreshing sipper for summer weather. And a reminder to check in regularly on Horton’s [social](https://www.facebook.com/hortonridgemalt) [media](https://twitter.com/HortonRidge) [accounts](https://www.instagram.com/hortonridge/) for their tap list. Their own beers are small batch and can rotate fairly frequently as can their guest taps, which have seen some killer brews already in the short time they’ve been open!

• The [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) gang on Robie Street in Halifax is keeping up with their Friday Cask in the Sun pledge this week with another variant on their _Goseface Killah_, this week again featuring arctic kiwis but replacing last week’s watermelon with pineapple. Should make for a super-refreshing and tropical afternoon and evening of sipping on the Gastroturf. And we’d love to tell you about the beer for this coming Tuesday’s Beta Brewsday, but it turns out we already did [last week](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/06/30/friday-wrap-up-20170630/), so go read it there. Due to a last minute change of plan, the _Re:Drella_ brewed by **Kelly Costello** with **Dan Hendricken** was bumped to coincide with Dan’s involvement in GR’s next [Just Vorlaufs!](https://www.facebook.com/events/119416655242147/) event also slated for this coming Tuesday. Meanwhile, last week’s beer ended up being the _Calypso White IPA_ brewed by Kelly with new Robot **Giovanni Johnson**. It was 4.6% ABV, with Cascade, Centennial and Nelson Sauvin hops and a misleading 91 IBUs because it was “definitely still crushable”. So crushable, in fact, that it was gone by 8:30pm.

• For those interested in learning a little more about what it’s like on the business side of taking the plunge and opening a brewery, look no further than the [Startup Canada Podcast](http://www.startupcan.ca/podcasts/) with **Rivers Corbett**. Their latest episode, #93, is a chat with **Mitch Cobb**, co-founder and CEO of [Upstreet Brewing](http://www.upstreetcraftbrewing.com/) in Charlottetown, PEI. Upstreet represents Mitch’s third foray into start-up businesses, so he’s got lots of experiences to share along with, we expect, some hints as to what’s coming down the pipe for Upstreet. Check Mitch’s episode out on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/startup-canada-podcast-canadas/id1037685040) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/startupcanada/startup-canada-podcast-e93-atlantic-canadas-beer-preneurs-with-mitch-cobb), preferably with an Upstreet brew in hand.

• We have more detail to add to the previous call for analytical beer testing by the CCNB: ‘‘Free chemical and microbiological testing! The CCNB-BTSC is collecting finished craft beer samples for a study on beer biochemical quality and local ingredients. This is for licensed craft breweries only. The testing includes: %ABV, SRM, IBU, sugars, organic acids, pH, anaerobic/aerobic _Lactobacillus_ strains, etc. Selection will be done on a first-come, first-served basis, so contact them as quickly as possible, as they are collecting a limited amount of samples. If you are interested in participating in the study and getting some free beer analysis and data interpretations that could help optimize your product and/or your brewing process, please contact Jared Christensen (jared.christensen@ccnb.ca 506-475-4029) to get filled in on the specifics of the project.’’ We are also able to share this [one-page primer](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CCNB.pdf) on the project.

**Another busy beery weekend is upon us. Shine up your drinking shoes, it'll be a large few days! As usual, check out our [Calendar](http://acbeerblog.ca/calendar-of-events/) for everything on the go in [AtlCanBeer](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATLCanBeer?src=hash) events, and be sure to let us know if we've missed anything!**

• Halifax's [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/) is welcoming back Portland's [Liquid Riot Bottling Co](http://liquidriot.com/) this weekend, after their eye-opening visit last summer. With a full range of beers from light wheat beers to hazy IPAs and big stouts, they are taking over the taps at the Barrington Mothership **today** from 6pm, and **tomorrow** at the Spring Garden Beer Garden from noon.

• Also happening all day **tomorrow, July 8th**, is [Propeller's](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) Gottingen Street Block Party in celebration of their Twentieth Anniversary! It's gotten even more epic and fun and outrageous since we first mentioned it [last month](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/06/23/friday-wrap-up-20170623/), with several more artists signed on, and an expansion of the venues.

This weekend is also the perfect time to check out the latest **Gottingen Small Batch** releases, two versions of a California Common, either _Sacramento Common _(5.5% ABV, 39 IBUs) or _San Diego Common_ (4.0% ABV, 35 IBU). Try them both, and let them know if you're a NorCal or SoCal kinda drinker.

• In Fredericton, the [Ladies Beer Connection](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonLadiesBeerConnection/) is holding their Six Month anniversary celebration next Wednesday, **July 12th**.

**Before you head out today...**

- Congratulations to Riverview's [Celtic Knot](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) who brewed up the first batch of beer on their new 4.5 hl (3.75 BBL) brewhouse this week. Look for that beer, and plenty more, in growlers when they open their retail location later this summer, and on tap at more spots in the region thanks to the expanded capacity.

- Oromocto's [Johnny Jacks Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/johnnyjacksbrewery/) have released a new beer, _Farmhouse Ale_. A Belgian-inspired 5.4% ABV light summer beer, it is available at a [couple of ANBL locations](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/ProductDetails/29231), and on tap in their neighbourhood.

- [Mill Street St John's](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) has released a new beer this week, _Best Kind _IPA. Hopped solely with **Mosaic **throughout the brewday as well as dry-hopping, the finished beer features plenty of citrus and pineapple flavours and aroma, on top of an unfiltered light body. At 6.5% ABV and 58 IBUs, this juicy beer is on tap for samples, pints, and growlers now.

- Halifax’s new cidery on the block [Chain Yard](https://www.chainyardcider.com/) had a new offering hit the taps on Wednesday. _Lime-Stone Sessional_ is a lower-ABV offering at 4.8% that features lots of citrus and stone fruit presence, perfect for a hot day on their Agricola Street patio.

- Nothing says summer quite like maple syrup! At least that's what the folks at Authentic Seacoast (aka [Rare Bird](http://www.rarebirdbeer.com/)) are thinking, as they have released their _Maple Ale_ at the [NSLC's The Port](https://www.mynslc.com/stores/store_2160) location. The beer is brewed using locally-collected sap in place of all of the water, and the beer finishes at 6.5% ABV. You can also grab a taste of the beer at their brewery at [75 Ferry Road in Guysborough](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Authentic+Seacoast+Distillery+%26+Brewery/@45.4015122,-61.5056357,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4b5ceb8404db0ae1:0x113ee0fc4364ba14!2s75+Ferry+Rd,+Guysborough,+NS+B0H+1N0!3b1!8m2!3d45.4015122!4d-61.503447!3m4!1s0x0:0x27fc76692be5ed44!8m2!3d45.4019002!4d-61.5035261) all summer.

- Charlo's [Savoie's Brewhouse](https://www.facebook.com/savoiesbrewhouse/) is switching their packaging from bottling to canning, thanks to a new acquisition in the brewery. The first beers to be packaged in cans in the coming months will be _Island Lake _Blonde and _Chaleaur Phantom_ Amber Ale, followed by _Charlo Falls_ Rye IPA, and _Heron's Nest _Porter. Also available at the brewery, and at the adjacent [Heron's Nest Pub](https://www.facebook.com/HeronsNestPub/), are _Sugarloaf Mountain_ Maple Amber, _Herons Island_ Orange Wheat, _Bullers_ Blueberry Wheat, _Bon Ami_ Strawberry Wheat, and _Restigouche River_ Raspberry Wheat. Look for their version of the Acadian Nut Brown to debut in the fall, along with their _Fall Fair_ Harvest Ale.

- The Calvados barrel-aged coffee we told you about last week from [Low Point Coffee Co](https://www.facebook.com/lowpointcoffee/) has now been roasted by Halifax's [Java Blend](http://javablendcoffee.com/) and packaged for sale. We've heard there's only 50 or so bags of this available (and we've spoken for two of 'em!) so if you're keen to try it out we suggest you not wait too long! Contact them on social media, or go see them at their stall at the [Alderney Landing Farmers Market](http://www.alderneylanding.com/market/).

- We can now report that [WestSide Beer Wine Spirits](https://www.facebook.com/WestSideHFX/) (aka Cristall Wine Merchants' new name and location) will be opening at [287 Lacewood](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/287+Lacewood+Dr,+Halifax,+NS+B3M+3Y7/@44.6627258,-63.6570606,18.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4b5a2059c4976767:0x53360ba727143f3b!8m2!3d44.6635091!4d-63.6579724) (in the former Brewdebakers location) early next week, probably Monday, July 10th. Featuring 8 taps for growler fills, several large coolers, and an expanded floor space for other, lesser beverages, it will be growing several times its current size.
