Good morning, beer fans! Here's your weekly wrap-up of craft beer news in Atlantic Canada...

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons)' English Brown Ale, 104th Regiment (see our previous post on this beer [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/friday-wrap-up-20130517/)), is now available in bottles at various [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) locations across New Brunswick. To celebrate, Picaroons will be having an official bottle launch next Wednesday, June 12th at the [Fredericton Region Museum](http://frederictonregionmuseum.wordpress.com/) on Queen St. The museum will also have an exhibit of ten paintings highlighting the 104th Regiment of Foot's trek in 1813. There will be samples of the beer available, as well as some snack****s. For every bottle of 104th Regiment that is sold, Picaroons will be donating 25 cents to the museum. According to Dennis Goodwin, Marketing Director at Picaroons, the 104th Regiment is just the first in a series of New Brunswick commemorative beers that they have planned for the future.

• Speaking of Picaroons, tickets for their [Brewer's Bash](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) this July are officially sold out. With only about half of the sixty breweries named so far, stay tuned for more information as it becomes available. Those who were able to purchase tickets should be in for a great time! Read more about this event in our [previous post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/more-details-on-picaroons-brewers-bash-in-july/).

• For those of you who were itching to try some [Shiretown Beer](https://www.facebook.com/shiretown) Blonde du Quai, but weren't able to make it up to Charlo to purchase some bottles or buy it on tap, it looks like they're expanding to some more ANBL stores. Keep checking the [website](http://www.nbliquor.com/location.html?upc=400000024493+&submit.x=44&submit.y=15); as of this week, there were bottles of this [award-winning beer](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/friday-wrap-up-20130419/) available at both the Bathurst and Fredericton York St. locations. Get it while you can!

• [Big Spruce Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) has released a new beer this week, their Regatta Red. It will be available in limited quantities at the brewery and some tap accounts. Details to follow shortly.

• Big Spruce will also be taking part in the[ Take-a-Bite Food Event](http://www.downtownsydney.ca/view-event.asp?id=29) in Sydney. It takes place Saturday from 11:30-2 at the Cruise Ship Pavillion.

• [Moosehead Brewing](http://moosehead.ca/home/) is releasing a new beer to the area, Boundary Ale. It appears to be an all malt beer, with 2-row barley as the backbone, and six others for flavour and colour. The beer incorporates English (Fuggles and EKG) and American (Cascade and Chinook) hops for bittering and aroma. At 39 IBU and 5.3% ABV, this is a definite departure from their regular offerings.

• [Late edit] Brewmaster [Greg Nash](https://twitter.com/__NASH__)'s newest beer at the [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) is [Rookie](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.com/2013/06/rookie-now-on-tap.html). The basis for the beer is an English Mild (3.3% ABV), however it is hopped up with a ton (approximately) of aromatic American Citra and Simcoe hops. Sounds like a great combo for those Saturday afternoon sessions.

Stay dry and drink good beer this weekend!
