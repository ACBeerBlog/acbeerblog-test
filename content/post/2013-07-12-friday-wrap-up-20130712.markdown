Happy Friday everyone!

• After a successful launch last weekend, [Boxing Rock Brewing](http://boxingrock.ca/) will be hitting up the Farmers Markets this weekend. Look for them at [Shelburne Farmers Market](https://www.facebook.com/ShelburneFarmersMarket), [Yarmouth Farmers Market](http://www.yarmouthfarmersmarket.com/), [Lockeport Afternoon Market](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lockeports-Afternoon-Market-In-The-Park/281195155343749) (held Friday afternoon), and the [Halifax Seaport Farmers' Market](http://www.halifaxfarmersmarket.com/). They will also be pouring samples at [Premier Wine & Spirits](http://premierwines.ca/store/) in Halifax, Saturday afternoon from 2-5pm. Shelburne locals (or visitors to the South Shore) can drop by the [brewery storefront](http://goo.gl/maps/Up6Ho) 11-8 daily (except Sunday) to refill growlers and grab a trucker hat. And two of their beer (Hunky Dory Pale Ale and Vicar's Cross IPA) will be available in the NSLC in August.

• It looks like [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) is taking another step forward in expansion - they announced this week [via a story on CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2013/07/09/nb-picaroons-gibson-roundhouse-810.html) that they have purchased a new brewery location on Union St. The former Gibson Roundhouse site was snapped up for $100, and will be transformed into a new brewery and tourism centre. Sean Dunbar, owner of Picaroons, told the CBC that he expects to spend several million dollars on the project; work should begin in the fall and be completed within a year. The current Melissa St. location will likely continue to produce beer in some capacity, says Dennis Goodwin, Marketing Director of Picaroons.

• Speaking of Picaroons, their much-anticipated Brewer's Bash beer festival will be held tomorrow at Officer's Square in Fredericton. Tickets for the event have been sold-out for weeks. Those lucky enough to be attending the event (or those who want to torture themselves) can check the full brewery and beer list on the event's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) (where they've also been giving away tickets for the last few days to lucky followers); we also posted yesterday on the Atlantic Canadian beers [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/07/11/brewers-bash-atlantic-canadian-beer-list/).

• In more Fredericton beer news, [Grimross Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) is following up their very popular Canada Day release of their Cheval D'Or Farmhouse with their second beer, Destrier Farmhouse Stout. It will be available in growlers at the Picaroons Brewtique, at the Brewer's Bash this weekend, and hopefully on tap in town soon.

• After a false start last weekend, the Dartmouth location of the [Propeller Prop Shop](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) opened Thursday. Located at [617 Windmill Rd](https://www.google.ca/maps?ll=44.697587,-63.603877&spn=0.004736,0.013078&sll=44.697427,-63.603682&layer=c&cbp=13,239.16,,0,2.75&cbll=44.697521,-63.60379&t=h&z=17&panoid=UxmLlGdv3RtqXFD1mn66MQ), the shop will have growlers and six-packs to go, as well as merchandise, and are open 12-8pm daily. Gottingen-location fans fear not, that Shop will stay open as their current brewery location will still be in operation, even when the bulk of the production moves to Dartmouth.

• [The Pump House](http://www.pumphousebrewery.ca/) just recently tapped a new beer at their brewpub location in Moncton. The Raspberry Wheat is fermented with a German yeast strain, and fresh raspberries are added during fermentation. At 5.5% ABV, expect a tart and refreshing finish... sounds great for summer!

• Fans of the [PEI Brewing Co./Gahan](peibrewingcompany.com/) Iron Horse Brown Ale will notice something different about the beer in the future... the name has been changed to Iron Bridge. Ironhorse is also the name of a [Pacific Western](http://www.pwbrewing.net/ourbeer/ironhorse/) beer, and PEIBC decided to change their beer's name to avoid any confusion.

• Looks like another successful [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) event last night at [Wooden Monkey Dartmouth](http://www.thewoodenmonkey.ca/). It featured the full line of [Big Spruce Brewing's](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) beer (Cereal Killer Oatmeal Stout, Kitchen Party Pale Ale and Regatta Red Ale), and owner and brewer Jeremy White was on hand to speak about and pour the beer. The LBL will have a couple of events in August, we will be sure to let you know the details.
