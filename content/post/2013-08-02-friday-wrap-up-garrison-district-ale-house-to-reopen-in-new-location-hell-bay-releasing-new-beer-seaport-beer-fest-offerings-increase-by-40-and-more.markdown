Good morning and end-of-week, fellow beer fans!

• For those of you in the Fredericton area (and beyond), you've likely been waiting - and waiting - for the [Garrison District Ale House](https://www.facebook.com/garrisonalehouse) to re-open after they were forced to close due to a fire in early January. Progress has been slow due to circumstances beyond their control, but co-owner Doug Williams has confirmed that they will be moving to a new location. In approximately eight weeks, they'll be opening at the old Mexicali Rosa's / Back Nine location on King St. With a larger space and larger menu (looks like they'll be offering more BBQ), we're extremely happy that things are finally looking up, and we're eagerly awaiting their grand re-opening!

• [Hell Bay Brewing](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) in Liverpool, NS will have a new beer available (albeit in limited amounts) very soon. Being described as an "Indian Brown Ale" (think: American Brown Ale), it will have an ABV of 6.7% and 45 IBUs. According to the brewery, this hoppy beer will also accentuate the malt flavors, along with chocolate and molasses. The beer will be pouring at the [Seaport Beer Festival](http://www.seaportbeerfest.com/) in Halifax next weekend, and should be on tap at select locations in the area.

• As for the Seaport Beer Fest, we'll be having a separate post on the August 9th-10th event soon. In the meantime, a full list of breweries and beers can be found on the event's [website](http://www.seaportbeerfest.com/breweries); with 110 breweries and 267 different beers, there's approximately a 40% increase over last year's numbers! Tickets are still available.

• There's a new beer in the works from [Celtic Knot Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing). Loki, a Black IPA, will have about 70 IBUs and an ABV of 6%. Brewed with three of the 'C' hops - Chinook, Centennial, and Citra - it should be available sometime in the not-too-distant future. Keep an eye out for it at [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Laundromat-Expresso-Bar/133734576637538) in Moncton.

• As [mentioned yesterday](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/today-is-national-ipa-day/), some of the breweries in Atlantic Canada cooked up special beers for National IPA Day. They should still have some leftovers, so be sure to seek these out if you weren't able to partake yesterday!

• And, just in time for IPA Day, [Boxing Rock Brewing's](http://boxingrock.ca/) DIPA, Vicar's Cross, was released yesterday. According to the brewery, it should be making its way to Halifax today. Look for it in 650 mL "bombers" at the same four specialty stores mentioned in the [Friday Wrap-Up](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/07/19/friday-wrap-up-barnone-beer-finally-available-on-tap-brewers-bash-leftovers-to-be-sold-at-anbl-greg-nash-brews-white-ipa-for-hart-thistle-and-more/) from two weeks ago. It will also be available at the [Seaport Farmer's Market](http://www.halifaxfarmersmarket.com/), and the [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/) within a couple of weeks.

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) has been hinting that they will release a special beer in honor of New Brunswick Day (Monday, August 5th). So far, they haven't provided any information on the beer, but stay tuned to their Facebook and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/picaroons) accounts over the weekend... something will likely be posted soon. Rumors indicate that it may be a re-release of their 506 Logger, a quasi-Kolsch that was originally released last year.

• In other New Brunswick Day news, the Fredericton Beer Run that [we reported on](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/fredericton-beer-run-to-be-held-this-summer/) will be held on Monday. Tickets have recently sold out; looks to be a great event for those participating!

That's it for this week! Enjoy your weekend!
