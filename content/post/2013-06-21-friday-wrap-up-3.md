Good morning, craft beer lovers! Here's a run-down of beer news in Atlantic Canada for the week:

• [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) has recently been pouring a new beer at their location on Gottingen St. in Halifax. Their Summer Ale is a "light take" on a Belgian Saison. With a 5.5% ABV, it's brewed with 100% Pilsner malt and Fuggle hops, and has orange peel and coriander seed added at the end of the boil. When in stock, Summer Ale is available in 750 mL and 1.89 L refillable bottles purchased at the brewery, and on tap in Halifax at [Tess](http://www.cheztess.ca/), and at [Jamieson's](http://www.jamiesons.ca/Jamiesons/Welcome.html) in Dartmouth.

• Those who have become [supporters](http://www.redroverbrew.com/p/want-to-be-newest-red-roverlutionary.html) of [Red Rover Brewing](http://www.redroverbrew.com/), the upcoming New Brunswick cidery, have already been invited to the next tastings of their new products.  Being held on July 3rd and 10th, they will be highlighting "some of the finest cider Red Rover has crafted to-date". If you'd like to attend, it's not too late to become a supporter and receive an invite!

• Another hop-bomb from brewer Greg Nash was tapped at the [Hart & Thistle](http://www.hartandthistle.com/) yesterday. [Columbus DIPA](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2013/06/columbus-dipa.html) is an Imperial India Pale Ale brewed exclusively with the Columbus hop, well-known for imparting a slightly-fruity, dank and "resiny" character when used in beer. Coming in at a whopping 9.1% ABV, with a very high calculated IBUs of 246, this beer likely won't last long... those in the area should get down to the H&T sooner rather than later!

• It's not for a couple of months, but [Propeller Brewing](http://drinkpropeller.ca/) has announced their next [cask night](http://drinkpropeller.ca/content/Cask_Night) will be on Friday, August 16th. Not only will attendees get to enjoy a Propeller beer on cask (along with other taps, including a special one-off beer), the event will also feature a "Sausage Fest Edition", where local chef Ludo Eveno will prepare "three delicious interpretations of the sausage". The cask will be tapped at approximately 6:30 pm, where one of the Propeller brewers will be around to answer questions about cask-conditioned beer. Tickets can be purchased [here;](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7137136367?utm_source=eb_email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=new_eventv2&utm_term=eventurl_text#) don't wait, as space is limited 45 seats!

That's all for this week. Be sure to enjoy the weekend with some fine craft beer!
