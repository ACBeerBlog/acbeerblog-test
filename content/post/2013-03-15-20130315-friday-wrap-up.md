Hello again beer fans!

A few updates since last week:



	
  * We had a great time at the [Fredericton Craft Beer Fest](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonCraftBeerFestival) at the Delta Fredericton Saturday. There were over 100 beers available from lots of local and farther afield favourite breweries, as well as  representatives from some new breweries that will be coming on the scene very soon. We'll have a full report shortly. Thanks to the organizers and volunteers for a wonderful event! Looking forward to next year (they've already got some breweries signed up to return!).

	
  * Speaking of New Brunswick Beer Fests, the [Saint John Beer Fest](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest) will be taking place April 13th at the Market Square in Saint John. Their VIP tickets are selling fast, so [jump on them now](http://www.harbourstation.ca/event/saint-john-beer-fest-1). We'll have a full write-up, with brewery and beer list, next week.

	
  * Also in Saint John, taking place at the [Saint John Alehouse](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/) is [Maple Mania](https://www.facebook.com/events/164570123701692/), March 23rd. [Picaroons](http://www.picaroons.ca/) Maple Cream Ale on cask along with lots of food cooked with or pairing with maple syrup. Sweet! Get your tickets at the Alehouse.

	
  * Attention Hop Heads: The Double IPA is back again from [Propeller Brewing Co](www.drinkpropeller.ca/) in Halifax. It is at the PropShoppe now, and will be in the private beer stores and NSLCs shortly. Sorry, not available in NB, PEI or NL.

	
  * It's been on tap in Port Williams for a week, and [Sea Level](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/)'s  Dussel-port Altbier is now available for sale in cans at the brewery in Port Williams, and  [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/), [Harvest Wines](http://www.harvestwines.ca/), and [Cristall Wine Merchants](http://www.cristallwinemerchants.com/store/) in Halifax.

	
  * The gala for [Garrison Brewing Co](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/)'s Home Brew-Off is next Thursday, when they will announce this year's winning Blonde beer. We hear that there are at least two [Brewnosers](http://brewnosers.org/) in the final four! It also means that last year's winning beer, Kellye Robertson's Rye IPA (name TBA at the gala), will be released the same night. We'll be there for a full report, this event never disappoints!

	
  * The Coast's annual [Beer Guide](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/beer-guide/Category?oid=1088150) is out this week, with lots of good articles on [homebrewing](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/homebrews-where-the-heart-is/Content?oid=3733640) for the Garrison Brew-Off, our friends at [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/), [NS cider](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/cider-report/Content?oid=3733704) and the weekly firkins at [Rockbottom Brew Pub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca). Pick it up across Halifax, or read the[ digital flip version here](http://www.thecoast.ca/general/flash/20_42_digitaledition/flipedition.html).


Finally, you will be seeing another new handle posting articles and profiles soon. Shawn is a homebrewer and lover of all things beer, living in Fredericton. I managed to corner him at the Fredericton Craft Beer Fest, and he has graciously agreed to help Nick and I to keep the info flowing. There's plenty of beer news in Atlantic Canada to keep us all busy, and only signs of it ramping up further! Thanks Shawn!
