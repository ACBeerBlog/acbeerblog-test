[Version 3.0 of the legendary Hop Mess Monster](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2012/07/hop-mess-monster-v30-release.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) will be available at Hart & Thistle Tuesday, July 24th at 5pm.  The brew was created using monstrous amounts of hops ( over 23lbs / barrel).  The beer is described as:


<blockquote>The world's hoppiest beer: thick with essential hop oils, juicy, fruity, dirty, sweaty, intensely hoppy and sexy just the way we like 'em!</blockquote>
