Happy Friday, everyone! Things have slowed down a bit this week in beer news in our region, but we've still got some info to share...

• With the opening date for their brewery approaching fast, [Les Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) has released information on their two inaugural beers. The first beer, a Blonde named _Bob LeBoeuf_, is a light-colored beer coming in at 5.2% ABV and 22 IBUs, while the second beer is a Wheat beer named _Tante Blanche_. Another light-colored beer perfect for the upcoming summer months, this beer has an ABV of 4.7%, and 18 IBUs. Both beers are named after real-life characters from the history of the Edmundston area, where the brewery is located. The brewery hopes to have both beers available to the public by late June; when released, look for them at [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) stores in the area, in singles and six-packs in the old "stubby" format; they'll also be available for sale at the brewery, along with 1.9 L growler fills. For more info on the beers and their label design, check out the brewery's blog post [here](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/en/blog/27-les-brasseurs-du-petit-sault-devoilent-leurs-deux-premieres-bieres).

• [Meander River Farm and Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/MeanderRiverFarm), after a sold out opening day on May 17th, will once again be selling beer this weekend. Open Saturday and Sunday 11-5, folks can drop by for a refill of their _Lunchbox Pale Ale_. Like last time, we suggest showing up early to avoid disappointment. While there, grab some of their lavender and hops products (grown and made on site), and take a tour of the brewery and farm.

• [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) has released their newest beer, _Hali-Lager_. With warmer temperatures finally breaking through, this should be a perfect "lawnmower beer", as it is a light-colored lager clocking in at a sessionable 4.5% ABV, with 17 IBUs. It was brewed with 2-row and Melanoidin malts, and lightly hopped with Hallertau Hersbrucker, with "a twist of Cascade hops in the finish". Get down to the brewpub to give this new beer a try!

• [Bix Axe Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery) in Nackawic will be releasing their _Simon Saaz Summer Ale_ this weekend. From brewer Peter Cole, "A ray of golden light shines through a thin patch of the blotchy white sky. Our summer ale is light gold in colour, dry and refreshing with a citric hop aroma and crisp flavours of orange and coriander. Released from a dark closet of winter, Simon Saaz Summer Ale is moderately hopped with 5.5% ABV and is sure to satisfy. It's a perfect summer day in New Brunswick". It should be available in growlers Sunday, and should make it on tap in the next few days as well.

• [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has announced that they're releasing their next Gottingen One-Off beer. Their _Smoked Ale_ is brewed "with ample amounts of Smoked malt"; it's a malt-forward beer that the brewery describes as pairing well with grilled meats and vegetables, as well as strong cheeses and apple pie. Look for it at both brewery locations for growler fills; it could pop up in limited quantities at the better beer bars in the HRM. Drop by today to fill your growler and, if you're visiting the Windmill Rd location, grab a grilled cheese sandwich from the [Cheese Gypsy](http://www.cheesegypsy.ca/) food truck.

• The [2014 Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) are being held this weekend in Fredericton, which means that the collaboration beer between [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) and [Great Lakes Brewery](http://www.greatlakesbeer.com/) is now on tap! _Eastbound and Down IPA_, a 6.5% ABV American IPA, was released last evening at several bars and restaurants around the city, including [The King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/), [Brewbakers](http://www.brewbakers.ca/), [The Snooty Fox](http://thesnooty.ca/), the [James Joyce Pub](http://www.cpfredericton.com/en/restaurants-dining/james-joyce-irish-pub), and [Wilser's Room](http://thecapitalcomplex.com/wilsers-room/). The last remaining keg will be released today at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf) for growler fills, starting at 5 pm. It goes without saying that this beer is in very limited quantities, so make sure you try it before it's gone! For more details on the beer, check out [our post](https://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/05/02/friday-wrap-up-20140502/) from earlier in the month.

• After a successful visit to the [Tide and Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) yesterday, the crew from [Trou du Diable](http://www.troududiable.com/) are making their way west to Fredericton today. The [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) will have a tap takeover of several kegs, and even more bottles, this evening. No tickets necessary, just show up for some pints and good discussion. You'll be able to chat with some folks from TDD, as well as other brewers from across the country, in town for the CBAs.

• The [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca) is celebrating their first anniversary in style! On June 20th, they'll be hosting a [fun event ](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/?event=ladies-beer-league-turns-one)at the [Wooden Monkey Dartmouth,](http://www.thewoodenmonkey.ca) in the Alderney Ferry Building. They will be pouring special casks from [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca), [Big Spruce](http://bigspruce.ca/), and [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/). No tickets necessary, just drop by, and pay as you go. The event starts at 7:30, and in addition to the great beer, you'll be able to pick up some LBL swag, and get some insight on what the future holds for the future. Cheers and congratulations!

• Nova Scotia's newest entry into the craft beer scene, [The Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/), will finally have beer available to the public next week! Both of their inaugural beers - _Principal Ale_, a dry-hopped Pale Ale, and _Chequers Ale_, a Robust Porter - will be on tap at the [Library Pub](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Library-Pub/398882863472537) as of Friday, June 6th, and at the [Spitfire Arms](http://www.spitfirearms.com/) June 7th. We'll have a full profile on the brewery early next week.

We're at the Canadian Brewing Awards in Fredericton this weekend, taking part in all of the conferences and festivities. We'll be posting some pictures and information on the event next week. Here's hoping that there's some awards won by some of our Atlantic Canadian breweries! The gala is being broadcast Saturday night, be sure to tune in on the [Canadian Brewing Awards website](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/).
