[Beer blogger Dave Evans, a.k.a. Beer Maven](http://beermaven.blogspot.ca/), will be hosting a beer tasting at Pickles Restaurant in Sackville, N.B. this Saturday at 4 pm.  The event is part of Pickles Fest which is three days of free live music (November 8th to 10th) with a poetry reading as well as the beer tasting on Saturday.  The tasting session is only five dollars and gets you samples of three different beers from the PEI Brewing Company with information and guidance offered by Dave.

Dave hosted a [Belgian themed beer tasting earlier this year](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/beers-of-belgium-beer-tasting-event-to-take-place-in-sackville-nb-july-28th/) at the same venue.

Here's a link to the [Q & A I did with Dave in August](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/q-and-a-with-beer-blogger-beer-maven/).
