[![SJBeerFest](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sjbeerfest.jpg?w=627)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sjbeerfest.jpg)

The second annual Saint John Beerfest is taking place next Saturday, April 13th, from 7:30-9:30pm. It is being held in the [Market Square](http://www.marketsquaresj.com) Atrium, adjacent to the [Hilton Saint John](http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-brunswick/hilton-saint-john-STJHIHH/index.html). VIP Tickets for the fest are now sold out (allows entry at 7pm), but there are still some available for the regular session. They are only available in person or via phone at the [Harbour Station](http://www.harbourstation.ca/event/saint-john-beer-fest-1), and are $60.

The fest will feature 130+ beers, over 20% of which are not available at the [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/). There will be roaming entertainment from [Atlantic Cirque](http://www.atlanticcirque.com/), with food from the [SJAH](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/),[ Smokin Pig BBQ](http://smokingpig.ca/) and [Grannans Seafood](http://www.grannanhospitalitygroup.com/grannans/) available. The event is also a fundraiser for [Ducks Unlimited](http://www.ducks.ca/).

I spoke with organizer Peter Stoddard (also owner of the [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/)) about the event.

**The Market Atrium seems like a solid choice for venue, can you speak about the reasons why you chose it?**

Time of year is important: April can be cold, so heated underground parking, available overnight, so no tickets. It's attached to the two major hotels uptown and easily accessed inside day or night. It is unique and has built in atmosphere. It's also attached to all the sponsored Restaurants. It's big enough to work, yet small enough to be intimate. Personally I love Market Square and it is Saint John's Festival Place!

**Why have you chosen D.U. as your fundraiser recipient?**

I have been a long time supporter of Ducks Unlimited Canada, I am the Atlantic Spokesperson for them. We do many events and fundraisers with them and I believe the work they do can be seen and touched by everyone around.

**Are there bands or other entertainment joining Atlantic Cirque?**




We have a live DJ playing house music in the back ground with a surround sound speaker setup and upgraded versus what we had last year. The atrium doesn't lend itself to be a great live music venue due to the acoustics, so we have opted out of that option for now.

**Can you comment on non-alcoholic options at the Fest?**

We will have Pop and Bottled water and I believe there will be some non-alcoholic beer options. The reality is it's a Beer festival, so we are encouraging Taxis, again easily accessible or there is a Beerfest rate at the Hilton for people that just want to make a night of it.

**Is there anything else we should know?**

It's year two, so we have learned a bit more about the flow of the space, what people are looking for and feel we have upped the bar and managed to keep the price at the same level. All of the food is included in the price of admission, we had great success with the food end of things last year and are looking at another great year for it!
