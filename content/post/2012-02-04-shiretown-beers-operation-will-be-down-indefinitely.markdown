[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/shiretownbeerlogo3.png)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/shiretownbeerlogo3.png)As reported on [Canadian Beer News](http://www.canadianbeernews.com/2012/02/03/shiretown-beer-stops-production-to-address-quality-control-issues/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CanadianBeerNews+%28Canadian+Beer+News%29) and on their [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/shiretown), [Shiretown Beer](http://shiretownbeer.com/) will shut down their beer production indefinitely in order to address a few brewing inconsistencies.  Fear not craft beer drinkers, both Picaroons and Pump House brews will remain available onsite at the Artisan Cafe & Brewpub in Dalhousie, N.B.

As someone [who recently enjoyed their brews](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/the-story-of-shiretown-beer-dalhousie-n-b/), here's hoping they are back in production in the very near future.  I'll post updates as they are available.
