Happy Friday, everyone! We've got a handful of new beers and ciders, and several great events to announce, but let's start with the return of a small brewery in Northern New Brunswick.

• Rumours have been circulating for several weeks, but we've been able to confirm that **Shiretown**, a nanobrewery in Dalhousie, then Charlo, NB that closed last summer, is planning to re-open this coming August. Owner/brewer Derek Leslie, who had been working as a sales rep for [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) in northern NB the past ten months, says that he has upgraded with a new, 2 bbl (230 L) brew system, about twice as large as what he had been using in the past. The new brewery will be located at [363 Chaleur St.](https://goo.gl/maps/REaBkp2pmF62) in Charlo, with a storefront onsite. Shiretown's three flagship beers - _Blonde du Quai_, _Siren's T'ale_, and _Big Brown Ale_ - will once again be in the regular lineup, with production focusing on bottles. The brewery's former website and Facebook page are still currently offline, but their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShiretownBeer) account still exists. We'll keep you updated on Shiretown's progress over the coming weeks!

• [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co-301456876447/) is bringing back a previous favourite, _Chocolate Amaretto Porter_. Brewed with Pale Ale malt as the base, Chocolate Wheat malt and CaraMunich malts were added to increase complexity. In addition, after primary fermentation was complete, cocoa, vanilla, and Amaretto were added to the beer, resulting in a 5.5% ABV "slightly sweet" ale with a "biscuity flavour and a hint of almond". Originally released once in 2015, brewmaster Wendy Papadopoulos was inspired by the flavours of biscotti (Italian almond biscuits) when putting together the recipe. Look for this one to be available at the brewpub sometime around the weekend of June 18th.

• [Bulwark](http://www.bulwarkcider.com/) is releasing a new limited-edition cider today, _Raspberry Cider_. This red-coloured, "crisp and off-dry" beverage features the usual freshly-pressed apples from the Valley, and unites them with fresh raspberries grown on Bulwark's winery property. Think of it as a follow-up to the cidery's very popular _Sour Cherry Cider_ from last summer, except this time it will be available in bottle format! Coming in at 7.5% ABV, bottles are available now at their retail shop, and hitting NSLC shelves within the next week, when it will also be available on tap at select accounts around the province.

• Truro's [Nook and Cranny](http://thenookandcranny.ca/) is releasing a new beer at the restaurant today, a _Rhubarb Wheat_. More than 25 lb of locally-harvested fresh rhubarb was added to a 300 litre batch of wheat ale, for a light acidic bite to complement the smooth base beer. With a low bitterness and 4.7% ABV, this beer will be a hit as the days get a bit warmer, and the evenings even longer. As with all of their beers, they can be enjoyed by the pint, or sampler, at the bar, and in a growler to go.

• [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) debuted their latest CommuniBrew yesterday: _Mikey's Chocolate Orange IPA_ was brewed on GR's pilot system by homebrewer [Mike Orr](https://twitter.com/Firemike59) during last month's **Open Brewery Day**. The 6.6% ABV and 56 IBU IPA includes several rounds of hopping in the boil, whirlpool, and dry-hop, featuring **Amarillo**, **Cascade**, **Amarillo**, **Cascade**, **Centennial**, **Crystal**, **Magnum**, and **Simcoe**. During conditioning, a tincture of cacao nibs was added for a healthy chocolate nose and flavour. The result is like a Terry's Chocolate Orange, with the chocolate complementing the citrus characteristics of the hops, on top of a solid beer with a smooth mouthfeel. As with all of the CommuniBrew releases, these are for sale on draught in the taproom only, and they do not last long, so drop by today!

• [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/) has expanded their Brewtique and taproom, featuring the addition of a very large communal table that seats up to 24, with additional seating to accommodate 50+ patrons. There are now 12 taps in the taproom, some of which will be used to pour products from other local breweries and cideries. If you're in the Edmundston area, be sure to stop in for a pint and growler fill! The brewery will be announcing their summer hours soon, allowing more time to visit and enjoy their beer.

• After a very successful release of their _Gut View_ Amber, [Lazy Bear Brewing](http://www.lazybearbrewing.ca) in Smiths Cove, NS is ready to release their second beer, _Bear Bones _IPA. This is a beta version of a bigger batch coming soon, as they dial in the intricacies of their [unique brewhouse](http://www.lazybearbrewing.ca/blog/2016/4/7/the-tin-man). Look for a few more details on the beer when they post in their blog later today. Both beers will be available at tomorrow's [Annapolis Royal Farmers Market](http://www.annapolisroyalfarmersmarket.com/), 8:00-1:00.

• [York County Cider](https://www.facebook.com/York-County-Cider-1377103705935771/) has released another batch of their _Ginger Snap_ blend after a brief hiatus. Made with 30 pounds of fresh ginger in a 700 litre batch, the aroma, taste, and zip of the eponymous ingredient complement the 6.5% ABV base apple blend. Blending the _Ginger_ with their _Blueberry_ or _Hopped Cider_ is also a popular occurrence with the cider's fans. It is available in growler fills and bottles, at their storefront at 418 York St.

• Fredericton's [Lighthouse on the Green](https://www.facebook.com/FredLighthouse/) re-opened to the public yesterday, in preparation for the summer season. Operated by the [Crowne Plaza](https://www.facebook.com/FoodatTheCrownDowntown/?fref=ts), the location will once again focus on food and craft beer, similar to when they first opened last summer. They have upgraded their bar to have a total of ten taps pouring, featuring [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) cider, [Pollen Angels](https://www.facebook.com/SunsetHeightsMeadery) mead, and a rotating selection of beer from various New Brunswick breweries. Now that summer is finally here (kind-of), be sure to drop by and enjoy a local beer on the Lighthouse patio! They are open everyday 11am-sundown, and as it is an outdoor venue, check their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/FredLighthouse/) for closure in case of poor weather.

• And in a late addition to the blog, [Maybee Brewing's](http://www.maybeebrew.com/) retail location has now received their taproom license. Enjoy samples and pints of their beer onsite, before grabbing a growler to go. Open 10-6 Mon-Wed, 10-8 Thurs-Sat, and 12-5 Sundays.

Now, let's get caught up on events in our region:

• Nyanza's [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) is launching their Food Truck Fridays **today** at noon, by inviting the crew from [Cruisin' Cuisine](https://www.facebook.com/ccft2015/) to the brewery. As today is Day of Portugal, they are concentrating on famous dishes from that nation, made with local ingredients. Grab some fresh food with your samples and growlers from noon to 6pm, and enjoy the musical stylings of Asaph Deuce starting at 3pm. Big Spruce will keep the Food Trucks coming in for the rest of the summer, Friday through Sunday every weekend until October. Keep an eye on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing/) for the day's visiting vendor.

• On **Saturday, June 11th**, Garrison is hosting their Backlot Bash!, in support of the [Ecology Action Centre](https://www.ecologyaction.ca/). Held in the parking lot of their new production brewery on Marginal Rd (about 100 metres from their retail and storefront location), the event features headliner [July Talk](http://www.julytalk.com/?lang=en), joined by [Alert the Medic](http://alertthemedic.com/), [The Brood](http://thebrood.ca/) and [Three Sheet](http://www.threesheetmusic.com/) as amazing local opening bands.

A late brunch will be served by [The Coastal Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/TheCoastalCafe/) at 2 pm, and _Caesareans_ - a Good Robot cocktail with Clamato and corn beer - will be pouring. No charge to attend, just pay by the beer/cocktail/massage/brunch.

A few more beer notes before we sign off today:

- [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) has re-released their _506 Logger_, this time in 6-packs of 12-oz bottles, the first time the brewery has packaged in this format. Coming in at 4.6% ABV and 15 IBUs, bottles are available at both Picaroons locations (Fredericton's Brewtique and Saint John's General Store) along with growler fills, with bottles also being found at ANBL stores.
- [Yellowbelly](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) has re-released their _East Coast Cream Ale_, an easy-drinking, 5% ABV pale beer that is a popular seasonal during the warmer months. It's available now at the brewpub only, on tap and with a small amount of bottles, for a limited time.
- [PEI Brewing](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) has released a new cask this week: _Lactic Soured Apricot Lager_. A tart take on their 4.5% ABV lager, using _Lactobacillus_ to sour the wort for a refreshing bite, along with apricot for a pleasant stone fruit character. As with all of their casks, this is for on-site enjoyment in their taproom only.
