While I can't confirm that it has arrived on newsstands, I can confirm a copy of the Spring 2012 issue of TAPS has arrived in my mailbox.  As usual, Atlantic Canadian breweries are well represented (other than the folks on the Rock).

The Bar Snacks section has news from the past few months and includes tidbits related to Picaroons, Propeller, Hart & Thistle, Pump House, Big Tide, Acadie-Broue, Rockbottom Brewpub, Garrison and Gahan.

An Atlantic Canadian city was voted second best beer drinking city in Canada and guess what two Atlantic Canadian breweries made the top 11 breweries as per TAPS Facebook vote?

Owner of Picaroons, Sean Dunbar, is featured in predictions for the beer industry for 2012 story.

Rothesay's Craig Pinhey authored an article about Doctoring Beer and also provides tasting notes for a couple of beers (as does PEI native Greg Clow).  Tasting notes for Picaroons Best Bitter and Gahan's 1772 IPA are also included in the issue.

Rarebird Ale is referenced in a story and Rogue's Roost's Lorne Romano is also included in the issue.
