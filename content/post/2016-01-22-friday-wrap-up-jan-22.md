Happy Friday, loyal beer fans! Grab a pint and get your weekend started with some light beer reading.

• After receiving their license to brew just [a few weeks ago](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/12/31/wrap-up-20151231/), [Bore City Brewing](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/) in Moncton have sold their first kegs. One of their first three flagship beers, _Marécage_ (a 7% ABV Belgian Saison), will be on tap tonight at the [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/FoodatTheCrownDowntown) in Fredericton, just in time for the Joyce's [One Year Anniversary](https://www.facebook.com/events/527444617417076/) of their expanded keg fridge! For those of you in Moncton, fear not... the beer will also be on tap this weekend at [Les Brumes du Coude](http://www.lesbrumesducoude.com/), with other tap accounts following in the near future. We'll have a Q&A post on this 1/2 BBL brewery for you very soon!

• More details on James Joyce's event: It is the one year anniversary of their expanded keg fridge (allowing them to carry beer from every brewery in New Brunswick), and they will be fully stocked tonight - with Happy Hour pricing on Fredericton breweries' beers - serving birthday cake, and having a grand time! New Saint John brewery First City will have their _Chocolate Coffee Stout_ available. Drop by for the fun, beginning at 5pm. And keep an eye out for their [Wassailing event](https://www.facebook.com/events/771797116276998/) February 6th with [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/), similar to their "Meet Your Maker" event, where they will be pouring multiple ciders during the evening. Red Rover's _Bee Cider_, made with honey from the hives on James Joyce's roof, is currently available in the pub.

• And speaking of Red Rover, their cider is now available at the [ANBL Growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) filling stations for the first time this weekend. After a very successful launch of their bottles [last week](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/01/15/friday-wrap-up-jan-15/), their _Fire Cider_ is on tap at the Dieppe, Fredericton, Sackville and Saint John growler stations while supplies last. And check out [ANBL's page](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Products?OrderAscending=true&Take=25&Skip=0&Search=Red+Rover) for availability of their bottles.

• [Meander River](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) recently released their newest seasonal, _Cold Porridge_ Oatmeal Stout. Featuring 20% rolled oats in the grain bill, the 5% ABV Stout features an aromatic coffee and cocoa profile. As the brewery puts it, "The breakfast of champions!" On tap now at the brewery and the [Flying Apron Cookery](http://flyingaproncookery.com/), kegs were also sent to [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/).

• Also out this week from Meander River is their latest seasonal cider, _Winterlude_.  This unique blend features McIntosh, Northern Spy, Russet, and GoldRush apples, all sourced from [Davison Farms](http://davisonfarms.ca/) in Falmouth. The 5.5% ABV cider has a semi-dry finish, crisp character, is cleanly fermented, and lightly carbonated. As with all of their ciders, the recipe blend changes with the seasons and apple availability, so if you're a cider fan, it's always a good idea to try the latest release.

• The new beer from [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) that we mentioned [a few weeks ago](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/12/31/wrap-up-20151231/) is now available on tap at the brewery. _Ryes-N-Shine_ was brewed with approximately 40 kg of Tangelos (both the fruit and zest were used) and a "significant amount" of Rye malt. Fermented with two yeast strains (one a Belgian Saison strain, one American), this light-coloured ale comes in at 4.9% ABV and 23 IBUs. Owner/brewer Stephen Dixon describes the beer as "light and crisp, with a clean palate", with the rye and citrus being subtle, but present. Look for it on tap at Grimross tap accounts in the province as well.

• Judging for the [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery/?fref=ts) 2nd Annual Home Brew Competition took place last Sunday at the [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/). The style was Strong Scotch Ale (aka Wee Heavy); judges were impressed with the quality of the entries received, but ultimately a winner had to be selected. Nova Scotia homebrewers Keith Forbes and Mike Orr received the top prize with their _Tilted Kilt_, and actually came in second with their other entry, _Kilted Tilt_! Third place went to Newfoundland's Mark McGraw, with his _More Than Just a Wee Heavy_. Both Forbes and Orr will be travelling to Hammond River soon, to brew a full-sized batch of their beer with owner/brewer Shane Steeves, to be released at select HR accounts. Congratulations to the winners!

• [Spindrift](http://spindriftbrewing.com/) is continuing their series of weekly brews on their Pilot system (their 7th Wave series), with this week's new beer being released today at the brewery at noon. _Knotty Buoy_ is another interesting one: it's a sour mashed Wheat Lager that has been aged on chopped rhubarb, cranberries, and hibiscus tea. Described by the brewery as "pouring ruby red, with a clean tartness complimented by bright fruit aromatics", it comes in at a sessionable 4.3% ABV (and 10 IBUs). As always with the 7th Wave beers, there will be a very limited amount available when released, and only for growler fills, so get there quickly to fill up!

• Charlottetown's [Gahan House](http://charlottetown.gahan.ca/) has released a new dark lager this week. _Cast Iron_ is 5% ABV and 36 IBUs. Dark brown in colour thanks to Blackprinz malt on top of a 2-Row, Munich, and Cara60 grain bill. The beer features a moderate malt and slight roast character, leads into a medium hop bitterness, making this an easy to drink take on the European style. It is on tap at the brewery now, and can be taken away in growler fills as well.

• Over in Nyanza, [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) is releasing their latest "Conspiracy" beer; this one is being described as a "Pine Needle IPA" that was brewed in collaboration with Ontario's [Sawdust City Brewing](http://www.sawdustcitybrewing.com/). _Read Between the Pines_ has a "deep pine needle complexity", with plenty of tropical fruit and pine thanks to large, late additions (and a dry hop) of both **Nelson Sauvin** and **Simcoe**, and a "big splash" of **Galaxy** as a second dry hop. Weighing in at 7.2% ABV and 48 IBUs, this sounds like a great one! It's available for growler fills at the brewery right now, and show follow at select accounts very soon. And keep your eyes peeled for the 3rd Annual Big Spruce Homebrew Competition-winning Czech Dark Lager, brewed by Eric Gautier and Justin Clarke at the brewery, to be released next week. Finally, the 2016 version of _Coade Word: Snowmaggedon_ was brewed earlier this week, and will be popping up on tap sometime in February.

• Speaking of embracing homebrewers, [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has released a beer brewed with homebrewer Jason MacDougall. MacDougall visited Shelburne in December, and brewed up a Scottish Ale featuring a healthy portion of Peat Malt, and 35 kilos(!) of Heather flowers. To offset the floral kick, local wildflower honey and a light dose of **Fuggles** was added to the mix. _Professor McDougall’s Oban Heather _Scottish Ale weighs in at 5% ABV and will be available this weekend at the brewery, [Alderney](http://www.alderneylanding.com/market/) and [Seaport](http://www.halifaxfarmersmarket.com/) Farmers' Markets, private beer stores, and on tap in Halifax and [Antigonish](http://antigonishtownhouse.wordpress.com/).

• Also released this weekend is their collaboration with Charlottetown's [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com), _Rumble in the Alley 2_. This [SMaSH](http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/keeping-it-simple-with-smash-brewing/) IPA was brewed with Dark German Munich malt and Ontario-grown **Santiam** hops from [Clear Valley Hops](http://www.clearvalleyhops.com/) in Ontario. The resultant IPA features malt notes of biscuit and honey, and hop notes of spice and citrus. _Rumble in the Alley 2_ will be available this weekend at the brewery, and at the private stores, Farmers' Markets, and on tap, next week.

• [Good Robot](http://wroughtironbrewing.ca/) is releasing a new beer today that is definitely on the "different" side. When homebrewing last summer, they discovered a currently-unidentified microbe in the brewery that "generates a lemon-like, funky character" when added to their beers. They've investigated with a bit of microscopic viewing, and know that it's neither _Brettanomyces_ (a wild yeast) or _Lactobacillus_ (a bacteria); they plan on sending it to the professionals for some thorough work. In the meantime, they've added it to a batch of their corn beer, and then dry-hopped it with **Falconer's Fight** and **Cascade** to add even more citrus character to the aroma. The final product, _Bank of Azealia_, should be available at the taproom later today for pints and growler fills.

• Next Tuesday, January 26th, is [Australia Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day). Needing only the flimsiest of reasons to throw a party (OK, OK, their head bartender is Australian), the crew at [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) will be going all out to celebrate. Starting at 4pm, they'll be blasting the [Triple J Hottest 100](http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/), playing Australian movies on the projector, and serving kangaroo sausages, meat pies, and holding a meat raffle. While they won't have _Toohey's_ or _VB_, they will have tinnies of _Foster's_ in the fridge in case their lineup of brews doesn't quite quench your thirst after your walkabout. For the rest of the details, check out the [Event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1545523809097555/). And drop by this Sunday at 4pm for some vinyl love, courtesy of [Black Buffalo Records](http://blackbuffalorecords.ca/), for an event called [The Spins](https://www.facebook.com/events/428988557296493/).

• The latest season of CTV's [MasterChef Canada](http://masterchefcanada.ctv.ca/) begins February 14th, and Digby resident [Les Barr](http://masterchefcanada.ctv.ca/Season-3-Finalists/Les-Barr) will be among the competitors. Les is also the man behind [Roof Hound Brewing](http://roofhound.ca/), a mid-sized brewery slated to open in Digby County later this year. We expect to see Les cooking with beer whenever possible, and flexing his homebrewing muscles during the competition. We wish Les lots of luck, and look forward to following along with the progress of his cooking, and brewing.

• Thinking about opening or expanding a brewery or other beverage business? [Springboard Atlantic](http://springboardatlantic.ca/) is hosting a **Liquid Courage** event Feb 18 at Acadia University. Featuring keynotes from Greg Taylor of [Steam Whistle Brewing](http://steamwhistle.ca/) and Dominic Rivard of [Muwin Estate Wines](http://www.muwinestate.com/) and Bulwark, the seminar will feature presentations on how to build brands, do consumer research, quality testing, and exporting beyond provincial and national borders. More details can be [found here](http://live-springboardatlantic.time.ly/event/liquid-courage-building-confidence-in-your-beverage-business/). The seminar runs 8:30-4:30, and [registration is now open](https://eventreg.acadiau.ca/events/rgs-liquid-courage-201602/).

• Details on the [Craft Beer Cottage Party](http://www.savourfoodandwine.com/craft-beer.php), part of [Savour Food and Wine Festival](http://www.savourfoodandwine.com/), are emerging. Being held 7-9:30pm, Feb 27th in the Halifax Seaport Market location, the event will feature twenty local breweries, plus a few others from outside the region. Already lined up, with a list growing daily, are: Bad Apple, Big Spruce, Boxing Rock, Bulwark, Gahan, Garrison, Good Robot, Hell Bay, Meander River, Nine Locks, North, PEI Brewing, Picaroons, Propeller, Rare Bird, Spindrift, Tatmagouche, Uncle Leo's, Upstreet. Also in attendance will be Innovative Beverages Agency (representing Muskoka and Central City), Goose Island, and Mill Street. Your $50+HST (or $65+tax to skip the line and take home a gift bag) ticket offers unlimited tasting during the evening. There will be food vendors onsite, including The Stubborn Goat. Entertainment includes live bands, and cottage party games. [Tickets are available online now](https://www.showclix.com/event/craft-beer-cottage-party/tag/widget).

• There are good things coming this spring to the [Halifax Stanfield International Airport](http://hiaa.ca/). Currently a craft beer wasteland, a new store carrying Nova Scotia liquor, wine, cider, and beer will be opening in April. **Liquid Assets** is a subsidiary of [Ironworks Distillery](http://www.ironworksdistillery.com/), and will be located post-security, on the domestic/international departures level. It will mean being able to grab a bottle before getting on a flight, without having to worry about breakage in checked luggage, or having forgotten a gift while visiting the area. Look for more details on selection and exact opening date soon.

• LATE ADDITON: [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released their latest **One Hit Wonder** Friday afternoon, _Fog City Coffee Porter_. This 5.5% ABV, 30 IBUs, Porter was brewed with whole bean coffee from [Java Blend](http://javablendcoffee.com/) in both the boil, as well as "dry-beaned" during fermentation and conditioning. As with all OHW brews, this is a growler- and draft-only release, with it on tap now for growler fills at the Windmill location, and later Friday evening on Gottingen St. And don't forget to pick up tickets to their returning Prop'r Cask Night, next Friday, Jan 29, 6-9pm. This edition will feature the food catering of friend-to-beer [Studio East](http://studioeastfood.ca/), and a special cask of _Fog City_, cask conditioned with even more coffee beans. Tickets are a steal at $30 (all in), which offers unlimited samples of both food and beer at the Gottingen St. Brewery, and lots of fun mingling with fellow food and beer nuts. [Tickets are available now!](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/propr-cask-night-ft-studio-east-tickets-20475296162)

A few more notes for this week: [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) has put together a new dark beer, to be released next month. They are staying tight-lipped for now, but we understand this is a Porter to be released around the 14th. We'll have more details closer to its release. Be sure to drop by [The Auction House](http://auctionhousehalifax.com/) on Wednesday for their monthly Beer School, where the beers from a particular brewery are paired with special dishes from their kitchen. January's brewery is [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons), with head brewer Myles MacKenzie making the trip himself to share some knowledge. Tickets are now on sale for a pair of Beer and Chocolate Dinner, hosted by [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons). Both are being held at 7pm on February 10th, with one at [BrewBakers](http://brewbakers.ca/) in Fredericton, and the other at [Shadow Lawn Inn](http://www.shadowlawninn.com/welcome.html) in Rothesay. This three course meal will feature chocolate-infused dishes, paired with beer.
