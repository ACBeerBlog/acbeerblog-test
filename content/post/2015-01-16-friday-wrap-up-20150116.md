After a quiet beginning to the year, we are now back to our regular-sized posts, chock full of new beers and other exciting news for our region!

• There's another new beer now available from [Les Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) - _Soeur Catherine_, an American IPA. The brewery named the beer after "a headstrong (and somewhat bitter) nun who taught elementary school in Edmundston for four decades". Hopped to 70 IBUs with lots of **Centennial**, **Chinook**,** Citra**,** Columbus**, and **Galena**, it has aromas of strong citrus, hints of black currant and pine, and "a subtle earthiness balanced by a touch of Caramel malt", according to the brewery. This 7% ABV IPA is now available for growler fills at the brewery, and also at the Dieppe ANBL store this weekend, as part of their growler program!

• Petit-Sault has two other new beers on the horizon as well! _Cappuccino Stout_ (name not finalized) is a "Coffee Milk Stout" brewed with real coffee from no fewer than three Edmundston cafes. Coming in at 5% ABV and 25 IBUs, it has a strong roasted aroma that is "dominated by flavors of freshly-brewed espresso and a hint of bittersweet chocolate. Look for this one to be available sometime in late February. The other new beer is a currently-unnamed "Maple Brown Ale", which will be brewed with "copious amounts" of local maple syrup. This beer will be brewed by an all-women brew team (including Petit-Sault's own Mychèle Poitras) as part of the [Pink Boots Society](http://pinkbootssociety.org/) [International Women's Collaborative Brew Day](http://pinkbootssociety.org/iwcbd/), and will be launched on Saturday, March 7th, just in time for [International Women's Day](http://www.internationalwomensday.com/) on March 8th. It will also be debuting at the [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) that Saturday night!

• Brewer Terry Piercey of [The Antigonish Townhouse](https://antigonishtownhouse.wordpress.com/) has been brewing upstairs above their pub for more than two years, experimenting with different styles and recipes. _Terry's Bitter_, a cask-conditioned English Bitter, is their house beer, and absolutely a must-try when visiting the Townhouse. Lately, they have been hosting "Double Pumped Fridays", when a second house-brewed cask is tapped as well. Recently, _Terry's Stout_ has made a big splash, selling out in a matter of hours after release. Terry himself was kind enough to share some details of the beer. This Dry Irish Stout is fairly bitter (from the **UK Fuggles** added at the start of the boil), and high in roasted malt character, finishing at 3.9% ABV. This was the first stout they've brewed and served from the handpump, and was a great success! "The pump highlighted the silky mouthfeel and produced a thick creamy head through the tight sparkler. I'm definitely not breaking new ground here but it's a very pleasant and easy drinking low gravity stout all around." Those of you who missed it last week, fear not! The Stout will be available today (as well as the Bitter), and will definitely be a regular part of the Double Pumped Friday rotation. But don't delay, as there is only 20 litres in the cask. For the the next two Fridays, Terry is serving his _English IPA_, in addition to the _Bitter_.

• [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has yet another new beer in their One Hit Wonder series, and it's available now at both Prop Shop locations! _Black Out_ is an American Black Ale (aka Black IPA) brewed with dark malts (Chocolate, Roast, and Black Prinz) to give "a hint of chocolate and roasty characters" to the medium-light bodied beer, and is hopped with plenty of **Warrior**, **Falconers Flight**, **Cascade**, and **Ahtanum** to lend lots of piney and resinous hop flavor. Weighing in at 6.9% ABV and 78 IBUs, you'll be able to find this one on tap at better beer establishments across the city, soon.

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) has a new beer coming out soon, to be released just in time for next weekend's annual [Shivering Songs Festival](http://www.shiveringsongs.com/) (Jan 22nd-25th) in Fredericton._ SS Cocoa Beware_ is described by the brewery as a "Dark Chocolate Wheat" beer, and is brewed with Carafa malt and real dark chocolate, giving this 4.8% ABV ale lots of chocolate and roast flavors. They plan on releasing it sometime next week (stay tuned to their Facebook and Twitter pages for exact details when they have them); you'll be able to find it in Fredericton at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf) for growler fills, and on tap at the [Snooty Fox](https://www.facebook.com/Snootyfoxpub), [Isaac's Way](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Isaacs-Way-Restaurant/106892732679079), [Wilser's Room](http://thecapitalcomplex.com/wilsers-room/), and several venues during the festival. It will also be on tap outside the city at the [Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) in Moncton (they're hosting a SS show on Jan 23rd) and [Ducky's](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar) in Sackville (in support of the town's [Stereophonic](https://www.facebook.com/events/771863992887686/) music festival the same weekend).

•[ Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is releasing their _Ol' Fog Burner Barley Wine_ today! After a brief hiatus in 2014, this favourite winter seasonal for those cold nights around the fire makes its return. The 2015 edition of this English Barleywine weighs in at a whopping 11.5% ABV, so their 500mL bottles are certainly made for sharing (or you ambitious Vikings)! While the rich malt backbone is the star of this copper coloured beer, **Nugget**, **Spalt** and **Brewers Gold** hops keep things balanced at 60 IBUs. Strong, but not sweet. Available today at the brewery store on Marginal Road, it will also be in the private stores shortly. _Ol' Fog Burner's_ [Glenora](http://www.glenoradistillery.com/)-barrel-aged brother (sister?) will sadly not be making an appearance this year, but we've been assured that it will be making a return in 2016. This beer is a great candidate for your cellar, for those looking to start, or add to, their beer collection.

• For those of you in Fredericton and Sackville, NB, your local [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) will be carrying Garrison Brewing's _IPA_ for growler fills this weekend. Also look for the return of their [_EKG (East Kent Golding) One Hop IPA_](http://acbeerblog.ca/2013/10/11/friday-wrap-up-20131011/) in six-packs available now at the brewery, and the NSLC shortly.

• There's a new beer on tap at [Rogues Roost](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) - _Winter IPA_. Combining a malty sweetness with lots of hop character (coming mostly from the **Cascade** variety), think of it as a juiced-up version of their regular IPA. It comes in at 6.5% ABV and about 70 IBUs, providing a firm, lingering bitterness in the finish. Hop on down to the brewpub to give it a try before it's gone!




• [Lion & Bright](http://lionandbright.com/) is celebrating their One-Year Anniversary tomorrow with a Tap Takeover by a couple of their closest friends: [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) and [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/). They will be sharing the bar and pouring a half dozen beers each, including some casks and brand new beers. Look for Big Spruce to be pouring _Bráthair Éric American Wheat_ and _Coade Word: Snowmaggedon _(more on these below), plus a few other new favourites and core brands. Boxing Rock will be pouring _U-889_, _Unobtanium_, _Many Hands_, and more from their core brands, as well as _The Vicars Cross DIPA_ on cask.

• Last night was the [Local Connections Craft Beer and Local Food Event](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/482/craft-beer-and-local-food-celebration-2015), and those in attendance were treated to the launch and return of several beers from over a dozen breweries. Here are a few highlights:




- [Wrought Iron Brewing Company](http://wroughtironbrewing.ca/) made its debut at the event, bringing four (FOUR!) beers to delight the thirsty attendees. _Tom Waits for No One_ Stout, _Cleveland Steamer_ California Common, and the first ever commercial [Gose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gose) beers in our region (_Goseface __Killah_ and _Gutter Sow_), a unique wheat beer style originating in Germany, traditionally brewed with coriander and salt. Their equipment from [DME](http://www.dmebrewing.ca/) has yet to arrive, so these beers were produced on their pilot system. WIBC will be making its official debut in the Spring; check out the latest from them on their [blog](http://wroughtironbrewing.ca/blog/).

- [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) released a pair of new beers, including Home Brew Challenge winner Eric Gauthier's _Bráthair Éric American Wheat_. Lots of late addition **Simcoe** and **Cascade** lend a great citrus flavour; 5.2% ABV and 22 IBUs. Also debuted was _Coade Word: Snowmaggedon_, the Winter Warmer we described earlier. With rum-soaked cinnamon, vanilla beans and fresh organic ginger, this beer has a great character for cold nights. Only local-sourced whole leaf **Nugget** and **Centennial** hops from their own hop farm, as well as [Southan Farms](http://www.southanfarms.net/) in NB and the Alan Doyle farm in NS. Look for both of these beers at the brewery, [Cape Breton Farmers' Market](http://farmersmarketsnovascotia.ca/cape-breton-farmers-market/), and at better beer bars now!

- [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) debuted their _Horns Over Hooves Double IPA_, the collaboration they brewed with the crew from [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/halifax/). The beer features **Chinook**, **Centennial** and **Columbus**, and was dry hopped with **Azacca**, finishing at 8% ABV and 77 IBUs. Look for it on tap at the brewery now, and at the Goat and other better beer bars shortly.

And finally today,

• [Bar Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) is holding another great Tap Takeover for all of you lovebirds out there. On February 14th, they will be welcoming [Le Trou du Diable](http://troududiable.com/) to Barrington St. While Stillwell has been selling excellent TdD beers for over a year, that is just a small selection of the incredible diversity of their offerings. The guys from Shawinigan will be bringing twelve draught beers (only a couple of which have been seen previously on the East Coast), as well as bottles of their excellent barrel-aged beers. There will be three tasting sessions: 12-3, 4-7, and 8-close. Tickets will be $20, which include a special printed glass to take home, and your first pour. Tickets go on sale today, drop by or fire them an [email](mailto:tix@barstillwell.com) to secure your spot. We'll see you there!

We hope you have a great weekend! If you're out drinking around Fredericton, [TrailWay Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) is now available on tap at [Vault 29](http://www.vault29.ca/) (joining their regular accounts, [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) and [540 Kitchen & Bar](https://www.facebook.com/540kitchenandbar)). This Sunday is the official judging day for the [1st Annual Hammond River Homebrew Competition](http://hrbrewing.ca/competition/); we'll be sure to announce the results in next week's post! Finally, [A.W.O.L. Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/awolbrew?ref=br_tf) has announced that they're now officially incorporated, and are narrowing down the location to open their brewery in the future... great news, and congrats to them!
