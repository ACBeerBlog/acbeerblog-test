Hello again, guys and gals! Here's your Atlantic Canadian Beer news for this week, to carry into your long weekend...

• For those of you who have been anxiously waiting to try some beer from [Grimross Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307?fref=ts), we have good news: your wait is almost over! Owner/brewer Stephen Dixon has confirmed that the first beer, a Belgian Saison named "Cheval D'Or", will be released sometime over the next week or so. A dry, light-gold-colored ale described as rustic, earthy, and slightly spicy, Cheval D'Or has an ABV of approximately 5.2%. The beer will be available in 750 mL refillable growlers at the [Picaroons Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?fref=ts) downtown, and will also be released in kegs to various restaurants/bars across the city.

• After a successful launch of their first beer at [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Laundromat-Expresso-Bar/133734576637538) last Sunday, [Celtic Knot Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) will be releasing another beer this coming Sunday, June 30th. The "Not Joe Average" is a 5% American Pale Ale that brewer Bruce Barton designed "to appeal to both craft beer lovers and non-craft beer lovers alike". The launch will again be at Marky's, and begins at 3:00 p.m.

• [Uncle Leo's Brewery](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/) in Lyons Brook (two kilometres outside of Pictou, NS, along the West River) is having its Gran Opening this weekend! Saturday from 2-9pm and Sunday from 2-6pm, the brewery will be open, serving samples of their IPA and Red Ale, as well as selling growlers to go. A bonus for those who drop by, the growler fee will be waived for this weekend only, and you'll receive a free glass with a fill! We will have a full profile of them soon. Welcome to the Atlantic Craft Beer Revolution!

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has announced that two more of their beers will soon be available in New Brunswick. The first beer is Nit-Wit, a Belgian Witbier (the perfect summer-style!) that was originally the winning entry for the 2010 Ultimate Brew-Off, brewed by Scott Tilford. The beer has since been brewed repeatedly by Garrison, and has won medals in both the 2011 and 2012 Canadian Brewing Awards (Bronze and Silver, respectively). The next beer is Garrison's second in their "One-Hop" series, Citra One-Hop IPA. This American IPA has 56 IBUs, and is brewed solely with the Citra hop, well-known for packing in lots of tropical fruit flavors and aromas. The Nit-Wit is now available at [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) locations across the province; look for the Citra One-Hop sometime over the next week.

• Residents of Charlottetown can now pick up [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) beers at the [Farmer's Market](http://peiflavours.ca/index.php/flavours-trail/listing/Charlottetown-Farmers-Market/) on Belvedere Ave. The brewery will be selling 4-packs of their bottled beers, pre-filled growlers, and some merchandise such as shirts, hats, etc. every Wednesday and Saturday from 9 am to 2 pm.

• The [Rare Bird Pub](https://www.facebook.com/rarebirdpub) in Guysborough, NS is opening today for the summer season. The brewpub is home to the [Authentic Seacoast™ Brewery](http://www.rarebirdpub.com/brewery/), and will have several of the in-house crafted beers on tap. Growlers of the beer are also available at the Skipping Stone Cafe next door.

• The next event from the [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) has been announced. It will be held at the at [The Wooden Monkey Restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/TheWoodenMonkey) in Dartmouth on July 11th from 7-9 pm, and will feature Cape Breton brewery [Big Spruce Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing). Tickets cost $15.00 and include 2 slices of pizza from the Wooden Monkey kitchen & 3 beer samples (including that of Regatta Red, which is not available outside of Cape Breton). Tickets are moving fast, so please contact [LadiesBeerLeague@gmail.com](mailto:LadiesBeerLeague@gmail.com) to reserve your spot.
