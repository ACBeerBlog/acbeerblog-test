This Saturday and Sunday, October 19th and 20th, the people behind [barVolo](http://barvolo.com/) in Toronto will be hosting the 9th Annual Cask Days, a beer event that involves 230 cask-conditioned beers and ciders from 124 breweries in Canada and the United Kingdom. Often referred to as "real ale", cask-conditioned beers have their fermentation completed in the cask, which acts as the serving vessel. The beer is often served warmer and less-carbonated than your typical draught beer, and give the brewers plenty of opporunity to try new ingredients and techniques with their beer. Several breweries from Atlantic Canada will be featured at the festival; here's what they'll be serving up to those lucky enough to attend the event in Toronto:

[Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) - Cereal Killer Oatmeal Stout

[Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) - Wet Willie Harvest Ale

[Bridge Brewing Co.](http://bridgebeer.ca/) - Strong Dark Belgian

[Garrison Brewing Co.](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) - East Kent Golding IPA (from their One-Hop series)

[Granite Brewery](http://www.granitebreweryhalifax.ca/) - Old Peculiar

[Hell Bay Brewing Co.](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) - English Ale

[PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) - Pumpkin Porter

[Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) - Mildred Irish Red - this is their Irish Red that has been dry-hopped with local Goldings hops from [Southan Farms](https://www.facebook.com/SouthanFarms) in Wicklow, NB.

[Propeller Brewery](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) - E.S.B., dry-hopped with Fuggles

[Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) - Premium Lager

[Rockbottom](http://http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) - Greg Nash IPA - we're not sure if this is something new for Cask Days, or if they just named it after Nash by accident... unfortunately we weren't able to get further details in time. However, rest assured it has a fair amount of hops!

[Uncle Leo's](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/) - Smoked Porter

If you're going to be in the area (or are reading this from Ontario), there are still tickets available for several of the sessions, [here](https://guestlistapp.com/embed/?host_url=http%3A%2F%2Fcaskdays.com%2Fwhats-cask&mobile=true&title=Register%20for%20Event&button_text=Register&events[]=176547#/events/176547/reservation). Cheers to our breweries showing what we're capable of brewing here in Atlantic Canada!
