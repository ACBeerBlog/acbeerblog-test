[The Brewnosers Homebrew and Beer Appreciation Club](http://www.brewnosers.org/) is hosting an Amateur Brewers Beer Competition May 23-25, 2015. While the Maritimes has seen an explosion of commercial breweries opening in recent memory, the homebrewing community has seen similar growth. A combination of new beer drinkers, those realizing not all beer is "fizzy yellow lager" and looking for beer with more taste, and those who enjoy the DIY culture and want to add beer to their repertoire are just a few of the groups to thank for this explosion. As Craft Beer grows, so does the Homebrewing community, and vice versa, as many commercial brewers start out as homebrewers looking to turn their passion into a career.







While getting comments on homebrew from family and friends is nice, it can be difficult to receive impartial feedback, especially if the beer is free and plentiful. Enter homebrew competitions, where homebrewers can receive honest feedback from judges drinking their beer blind, without any preconceived notions. Local breweries have supported this idea by giving homebrewers an opportunity to do that for years ([Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/), [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/), [Gahan House Charlottetown](http://charlottetown.gahan.ca/), and [Hammond River](http://hrbrewing.ca/) to name a few), but those competitions are usually restricted to one style, as the winning brew will be turned into a commercial beer. With 23 categories and more than 80 sub-categories recognized by the BJCP, many homebrewers brew outside of these single styles.







This is where homebrew clubs come in! For more than 30 years, Canadian amateur/homebrew clubs have been holding competitions to allow entrants to receive honest feedback on their brews, earn some bragging rights, and maybe some cool prizes at the same time. Annual club competitions are hosted in [Vancouver](http://www.vanbrewers.ca/), [Calgary](http://www.yeastwranglers.ca/Competitions/Roundup15/tabid/432/Default.aspx), [Saskatchewan](http://www.alesclub.com/ales-open/), [Montreal](http://www.montrealers.ca/competitions/), and many cities in between. In Halifax, the Brewnosers have previously hosted [All About Ales](http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/Recreation/BrewNoser/all_about_ales.html) in 1999, a combination homebrew competition and conference at [John Shippey's Brewing Company](http://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/brewing-company-1357.htm) and [Rogues Roost](http://www.roguesroost.ca/), but have not hosted an annual competition until now. Thanks to passionate Brewnosers members willing to donate their time to organize and judge the competition, Canada's East Coast will become an integral part of the homebrew competition circuit. One driving force behind the renewed interest is Jeff Pinhey, one of the original Brewnosers members when the group formed in 1986. As a National ranked BJCP judge, he has lead study groups and beer seminars in our region, including guidance and study assistance for a crop of a dozen new BJCP judges in 2013. The [Beer Judge Certification Program](http://www.bjcp.org/) is an international non-profit organization encouraging knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of beer, by offering a standardized method for evaluation, ranking, and giving feedback. There are more than 15 BJCP judges in our region, who have taken both knowledge- and tasting-exams, and most of them will be taking part as judges (or participants) in this homebrew competition.







Registration for the Inaugural Brewnosers Homebrew Competition is now open, and accepting entries from amateur brewers from across the country. All [BJCP beer styles](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php) are welcome, and will be evaluated by a team of BJCP-certified and industry-member judges. As the name implies, only beer brewed by amateur brewers, on non-commercial systems may enter (commercial brewers can/should enter the [CBAs](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/), whose registration ends April 1st). The competition is also registered as part of the [Brewer of the Year](http://www.breweroftheyear.com/about/), which tracks amateur brewing competitions across Canada. All entrants will receive honest feedback on their entries by means of [scoresheets](http://www.bjcp.org/docs/SCP_BeerScoreSheet.pdf), and the top entries in each category may be eligible for prizes from competition sponsors. The Best of Show winning brewer will have the opportunity to work with [Best Case Beer](http://bestcasebeer.ca/) to produce a DIY Craft Beer kit from their winning beer, to be sold at homebrew shops across Canada. Other sponsors, as of publishing time, include [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/), [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/), [Breton Brewing](https://twitter.com/bretonbrewing), [FastRack](https://www.thefastrack.ca/), [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/), [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/), [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/), [Wrought Iron Brewing](http://wroughtironbrewing.ca/), and we here at the ACBB, with more groups expected to assist with category prizes and other sponsorship.







The deadline for registration is May 15 at 5pm, and **must** be done online at [www.brewnosers.org/competition](http://www.brewnosers.org/competition). Samples (2 bottles of each entry) may be dropped off at any [Noble Grape](http://noblegrape.ca/) (in the HRM and in [Coldbrook](http://noblegrape.ca/find-a-store/#coldbrook) and [Fredericton](http://noblegrape.ca/find-a-store/#fredericton), with the [Burnside](http://noblegrape.ca/find-a-store/#burnside) location being the central point for accepting mailed entries) before the same deadline. Costs are $7 per entry (and $5 for subsequent, via online payment only), and the number of entries is being capped at one per sub-category and 15 total per entrant, and 325 overall. As of publishing time, there are more than 150 entries registered, from brewers across the country.







If you are interested in supporting the competition by means of sponsoring a category, or donating funds, merchandise or time towards the prizes and logistics of the competition, please contact Competition Coordinator [Andrew Newton](mailt:Brewnosershomebrewcompetiton@gmail.com). The goal of the organizers is to have the competition break even, while providing the entrants, judges, and supporters a valuable and worthwhile event.
