In 2008, SSP Publications published Bob Connon’s Sociable!  The Elbow Bender’s Guide to Maritime Pubs.  In it, Bender provides an overview of the best pubs in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and P.E.I., all of which he visited in the preparation of the book.  The book is top heavy with Nova Scotia pubs with 35 in total described (including not surprisingly 13 for HRM), 6 for NB (O’Leary’s in Saint John and St. James Gate in Moncton are shocking omissions) and 4 for PEI.

The book doesn’t rate the pubs or its beverages but provides key information related to the establishment (on tap domestic and imports, bottled domestic and imports, hours of operation, contact information, other drinks, capacity including whether or not there is a patio, hours of operation, indicates if there is live entertainment, payment options and other information).    Each pub specific write up also provides an overview of the type of food offered.

The book also includes a section that describes what actually constitutes a pub and an overview of Maritime breweries, microbreweries and brewpubs.  The book is a must own for anyone interested in knowing more about Atlantic Canada brews and the best places to consume them.
