Moosehead Brewery Raises A Beer To All Things Made Well

First stop for Moosehead’s cross-Canada road trip - Saint John, New Brunswick

May 15, 2012 (Toronto, ON) – Moosehead Breweries Limited, Canada’s oldest and largest independent brewery, is excited to announce its home of Saint John, New Brunswick as the first stop of its Summer 2012 cross-country tour celebrating all things made well. On Tuesday, May 22nd both Andrew Oland, President of Moosehead Breweries Limited and the company’s brew master will be on hand to greet some very special guests at the brewery.

The To All Things Made Well tour is connecting a documentary film crew with Canadians who share the Moosehead passion and ethos for creating quality, well-made products. By sitting down over a beer and talking with craftspeople, Moosehead is showcasing why Canadians create and produce the best of the best, no matter what they choose to do. From food to sports to fashion to outdoor life to music, Moosehead plans to meet and share news about the personalities who help make this country great.

Consumers are invited to follow the tour at [www.facebook.com/moosehead](http://www.facebook.com/moosehead) where the journey is documented daily. A series of mini-documentaries showcasing key stops along the way is released throughout Summer 2012, while an ongoing contest provides consumers with the chance to win some of the innovative products featured on the tour.

“Canadians love their beer, but they also have a strong appreciation for locally made products,” says Katie Kennedy, Director of Marketing for Moosehead Breweries. “This journey is Moosehead’s way to hit the road and celebrate the Canadians who share our passion, our independent drive and our appreciation for all things made well. What better place to launch the tour than our home.”

The Moosehead-branded Airstream RV travel is travelling coast-to-coast across the country continuing across Canada from Saint John across to British Columbia, to Toronto for the North by Northeast (NXNE) festival on June 11, 2012.

The journey is the kick-off for Moosehead’s new To All Things Made Well marketing and advertising platform designed by recently appointed creative agency-of-record Sid Lee. Elements of the campaign commenced in May in the form of a social media content strategy; digital, radio and television advertising; on-premise promotions; and extensive outreach via PR and blogger campaigns.

“There are so many reasons why this campaign is perfect for us,” says Kennedy. “Of course we want more Canadians to give Moosehead a try, but what we’re really trying to do is share the essence of who we are. By encouraging recognition of local Canadian talent we are connecting their craft with ours. We are delighted to first meet our own beer artisans in our backyard.”

A full list of To All Things Made Well journey stops and craftspeople will be posted throughout the tour at [www.facebook.com/moosehead](http://www.facebook.com/moosehead).
