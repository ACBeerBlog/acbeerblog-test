Happy Friday, craft beer fans! Looks like there's lots going on in the beer scene in Atlantic Canada again this week...

• A couple of weeks ago, we alluded to a new beer being released by [BarNone Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing), and we now have some more details. An American Pale Ale, the beer was brewed in collaboration with [Bicycle Craft Brewery](http://www.bicyclecraftbrewery.ca/), a new brewery opening soon in Ottawa. Owned by husband and wife team Fariborz and Laura Behzadi, they came in contact with BarNone brewer/co-owner Don Campbell when they ordered their brewhouse through [DME](http://www.dmeinternational.com/), which constructed a similar setup to what BarNone brews on. When Don invited Fariborz and Laura to do a test brew on his system, so they'd be familiar with the setup, Fariborz designed a recipe and sent it Don's way. A few minor changes were made due to ingredient availability, and then the three met at BarNone to brew the beer. _Broke Spoke Pale Ale_ was born! A Pale Ale with a "good amount of malt backbone, so that it balances the hop bittermess", the beer still has a good amount of hop flavors and aromas coming through. _Broke Spoke_ made its debut last night at BarNone's weekly growler night; it may pop up on tap at bars/restaurants across the Island in the near future.

• Tickets are now on sale for this month's Beer Dinner (Tuesday, June 24th at 6:00 pm) at the [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) in Halifax. There are only 30 spots available; each ticket sells for $35, which includes three courses paired with beer. This month's dinner consists of a pork belly slider paired with their _Intergalactic SMaSH'd Lager_, beer-marinated, grilled Cornish hen (with newly-tapped Hali-Lager), and a black pepper & strawberry shortcake (_Jacktar Stout_). You can reserve tickets by calling the brewpub (902-423-2938); act quickly, they usually sell out fast.

• While on the topic of Rockbottom, if you haven't had a chance to try _Wreckoning RIS_ - their [Russian Imperial Stout](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style13.php#1f) that recently won Atlantic Canada's only gold medal at the [2014 Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) - or just want to try it again, they will be pouring the beer next Wednesday, June 11th at 4:00 pm. Get in and get some while you can!

• Also, if you're anxious to start having lunch at the Rockbottom again (or starting your pub crawl a little earlier), they've announced that they're now open on weekdays starting at noon, with a good possibility of opening at noon on weekends as well, later in the month.

• The 2nd Annual [Fredericton Beer Run](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonBeerRun) is being held this summer on Monday, August 4th (New Brunswick Day). Like last year, the event involves a run along Fredericton trails starting at noon, followed by lots of beer! Registration begins at 11 am; participants can choose to run either a 6 or 12 km route. Tickets are $50 and can be purchased [online](https://raceroster.com/events/2014/2796/fredericton-beer-run); they include a custom-designed running bib and beer stein, water stops, and 14 beer tickets. Each beer ticket is good for a 4 oz sample of beer or cider, with at least 20 different beers/ciders available to sample; this part of the event will be held at the [Delta Fredericton](https://www.deltahotels.com/Hotels/Delta-Fredericton)). New Brunswick breweries Big Axe, [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307), [Moosehead](http://moosehead.ca/), [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/), [Railcar](http://railcarbrewing.com/), Red Rover, and Shiretown will be pouring; [Unibroue](http://www.unibroue.com/) and [McClelland Premium Imports](http://www.mcclellandbeers.ca/) will also have some beers to sample.

• We hope you've purchased your tickets to [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons)' 2nd Annual [Brewer's Bash](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) on Saturday, July 12th in Fredericton, because they're now officially sold out! Even with an extra 500 tickets being sold this year, they still went very quickly. They've also announced the three musical acts that will be playing throughout the day-long event: [Zeus](http://themusicofzeus.com/), [Cyndi Cain](http://cyndicain.com/), and [The Chronos Band](http://thechronosband.com/). We'll keep you posted on the breweries that will be attending as the Bash gets closer. And a reminder: they're still looking for volunteers if you'd like to attend - 4 hours of helping out will allow you 8 free hours to enjoy the festival, so send them an [email](mailto:volunteer<at>picaroons.ca) if you're interested!

• And speaking of Picaroons, they've picked the winning cat for their _Melonhead_ bottle label... the lucky kitty is Ruby, who was entered in the contest by her owner, Madison Sagle. _Melonhead_ is now on tap at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf), and should be popping up at restaurants and bars in the area, as well as in bottles, over the next couple of weeks.

• The new Imperial IPA from [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery), _Too Hop to Handle_, that we mentioned last month has been kegged and is awaiting ANBL approval, which means it should be on tap in Saint John soon. Brewed almost exclusively with the Zythos hop, we're looking forward to a fruity and piney hop bomb!

• [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) has a new beer on tap exclusively at the brewery at 96 Kensington Road in Charlottetown. While currently unnamed, the beer is a Light Lager (4% ABV) that has a low bitterness (8 IBUs) from **Kohatu**, a New Zealand hop variety.  The beer was then "highly dry-hopped" with another NZ variety, **Motueka**, giving the beer a "tropical and piney" aroma, according to the brewery. Sounds like an interesting cross between a Light Lager and IPA... better get to the brewery to give it a try!

• [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) in Halifax has released a new seasonal, their _Summer Saison_. Changed slightly from their standard _Saison_, it features coriander and orange peel in the beer, to enhance the already vibrant and spritzy character of the base beer. Both ingredients shine through in the aroma as well, complemented by the hop characteristic and yeast spiciness. It weighs in at 5.5%ABV, and is available at the brewery and [Alderney Landing Market ](http://www.alderneylanding.com/market/)(Saturday only) in growlers, and on tap around Halifax and Dartmouth, and in Lunenburg at [The Grand Banker](http://www.grandbanker.com/). When the weather turns colder (let's hope that's 6 months from now!), they have plans of switching up the recipe to a _Winter Saison_, featuring ginger and black pepper.

• In more new beer news, [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/) just announced today that they have a new beer available for growler fills at the brewery. All we know right now is that it's an IPA, and is called _Hops on for Nowhere_. We'll have more info on this beer for you next week!

• If you're living in the Sackville area, and are into craft cider, good news! [Red Rover Brewing](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) now has their _Summer Brew_ on tap at [Ducky's Bar](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar). _Summer_ is a dry cider, described by Red Rover as a sharp, tangy thirst-quencher; it comes in at 7% ABV. Look for Red Rover's other two regular releases, _Spring Brew_ and _Fall Brew_, to follow after the _Summer_ keg has kicked.

• Ducky's also announced yesterday that they have the new [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery) summer seasonal, _Simon Saaz Summer Ale_, on tap. Check out [last week's post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/05/30/friday-wrap-up-20140530/) for more info on this beer. To follow, they'll be tapping another Big Axe seasonal, _White Birch Porter_. A 6.5% ABV Porter brewed with pure white birch sap, owner/brewer Peter Cole describes the beer as dark brown in color, and medium-bodied. Slightly smoky, with an aroma of "dark roasted nuts, rye bread and chocolate", the bitterness of the birch sap "complements the noble hops nicely".

• [Yellowbelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) is releasing a new brew this weekend. _Downtown Brown_ is an American-style Brown Ale, weighing in at 6.2% ABV and 40 IBUs. The grain bill consists of Canadian Pale, English Maris Otter, Canadian Munich, Scottish Carastan and Scottish Black Malt... a truly international bunch! The beer is hopped in the boil with Nugget and Galena, and then dry-hopped with Chinook and Ahtanum, and then with Topaz. A great blending of the chocolate, caramel, and roast from the grain, spice, herbal, pine and tropical fruit from the hops, will make this a great brew.

• A reminder that the [2014 Newfoundland Liquor Commission Beer Expo](http://www.nlliquor.com/events/special-events/beer-expo-2014) is happening at the St. John's Convention Centre this weekend. Box Office tickets are sold out, however there are lots available online as people's plans change. For those unable to attend, or want to grab some of their favourites after the fest, check out [this thread](http://www.beerthief.ca/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=382&start=240) on the [Beerthief](http://www.beerthief.ca) forum for a list of special Festival beers that will be showing up at your local NLC this weekend. Cheers!

• If you can't be on The Rock this weekend, then be sure to make it out to one of the local bars in your area. If you're in the Annapolis Valley, be sure to drop by the [Library Pub](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Library-Pub/398882863472537) in Wolfville tonight, and the [Spitfire Arms](http://www.spitfirearms.com/) in Windsor tomorrow, to help celebrate the launch of [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/). In Halifax? Drop by [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) at noon Saturday to grab a pint of [Meander River](https://www.facebook.com/MeanderRiverFarm)'s _Lunchbox Pale Ale_. For those of you who haven't had a chance to grab some from the source in Ashdale, it's definitely worth picking up!

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) [is hiring](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/show/careers): a full-time, permanent Brewery Sales Rep and a Seasonal Events & Sales Rep (full-time until September, possible part-time after), send off your resumes today! And even though the noon First Sips (aka Early Bird) tickets for their Cask Takeover June 21 at Stillwell are sold out, there will be lots of beer still flowing once the doors re-open at 2pm that afternoon, so be sure to drop by. We'll have some more details on the casks available this coming week, but we got word of another one: their popular _Peanut Butter & Jelly_ blend (Nut Brown and Raspberry Wheat), with raspberries from [Noggins Corner](http://www.nogginsfarm.ca/) right in the cask.
