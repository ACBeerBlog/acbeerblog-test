Howdy, craft beer drinkers! Here's some beer-related news to cool you off at the end of the week...

- It's been a long-time coming, but after a soft launch at the PEI Beer Festival in September of 2011, [Barnone Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) (located in Rose Valley, PEI) finally has their beer available for the public! They have two beers  currently on tap at [The Landing Oyster House and Pub](http://thelandingpei.com/) in Tyne Valley. Their "Pale Ale" is an American Pale Ale, and "Summer Sessions" could be described as an American Wheat. Both beers should be on tap at other locations on PEI soon, and the brewery should hopefully be filling growlers in the not-too-distant future. Head over to the [full story](http://www.peibeerguy.com/2013/07/the-two-year-thirst-barnone-has-been.html) on the PEIBeerGuy blog for more info.

- Missed the [Picaroons Brewer's Bash](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) last Saturday in Fredericton? Well, your chances to try some of the 300 beers featured may not be completely gone - apparently the [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) will be selling the "leftovers" from the festival at four of their stores (York St. and Prospect St. in Fredericton, Vaughan Harvery Blvd. in Moncton, and the Quispamsis location). Details aren't great yet, but stay tuned to the ANBL website and Brewer's Bash Facebook page... beers should hopefully be in stores by early next week.

- Looking for another tasty Greg Nash creation? The [Hart & Thistle](http://www.hartandthistle.com/) tapped [Hoplessness](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2013/07/hoplessness-white-ipa.html) yesterday - a hybrid Witbier/IPA (aka White IPA) that is low in bitterness (5 IBUs), but high in hop aroma due to a large addition at the end of the boil. Clocking in at 6% ABV, and brewed with curacao orange peel and coriander spices in the traditional Witbier fashion, it sounds like a great summer beer!

- If you're in the Moncton/Dieppe area and were hoping to find some more [Celtic Knot](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) beer, [Marky's](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Laundromat-Expresso-Bar/133734576637538) has recently tapped another keg of the Hopicide. The Not Joe Average Pale Ale should also be on tap again sometime in the near future.

- For those of you in PEI needing some local craft beer in large amounts, [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) is now renting kegs of all their beers. Kegs are available in one of three sizes: 19 L, 30 L, and 50 L, and can be picked up at their new retail space on Kensington Rd, in Charlottetown. Call ahead to make your order.

- [Boxing Rock Brewing](http://boxingrock.ca/) continues to expand, as their beers will become available in Halifax starting this weekend. Their Temptation Red Ale will be the first beer out for purchase; Haligonians should expect to see the Hunky Dory Pale Ale the following week, and then the Vicar's Cross DIPA another week later. Look for their beers at [Premier Wine & Spirits](http://premierwines.ca/store/), [Harvest Wines](https://www.facebook.com/harvestwines), [Bishop's Landing](http://bishopslanding.com/), and [Cristall Wine](http://www.cristallwinemerchants.com/store/), with the [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/) following soon.

- [Bridge Brewing Company](http://bridgebeer.ca/) has announced that they will be selling their beer in 750 mL growlers at the [Historic Farmers' Market](http://www.historicfarmersmarket.ca/) in Halifax every Saturday. Which beer(s) will be available will depend on what is leftover from the previous day's sales at the brewery; T-shirts and glasses will also be available for purchase.

That's all for this week. ACBBChris is away on vacation for several weeks, so don't be surprised if the quantity (and quality!) of posts drops during that period. Have fun, Chris!
