Happy Friday, everyone! We've been swept up in the fun and excitement that is [#NSCraftBeerWeek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nscraftbeerweek?f=realtime), with lots of great events, dinners, and tap takeovers. There are still a few events this weekend, including tonight's [Brews Cruise](http://store.mtcw.ca/p/198/craft-beer-week-brews-cruise) on the tall ship Silva and Tap Takeover at Windsor's [Spitfire Arms](http://www.spitfirearms.com/) (featuring [Meander River](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/), [Schoolhouse](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/) and [Sea Level](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/)), tomorrow's sold out [Full House Craft Beer Fest](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/499/full-house-craft-beer-fest), and Sunday's [Brewer's Brunch](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/brewers-brunch-tickets-16054442269) at the Stubborn Goat, so be sure to take them in.

• The _Race the Kegs _event will take place tonight at the [Gahan House Harbourfront](http://halifax.gahan.ca/). Racing in from the Bedford Yacht Squadron on 24-foot sailboats, the North and South teams will be competing to see who can get their kegs tapped and pouring first. The event kicks off around 6:30pm. The "South" team ([Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/), Gahan House, [Hell Bay](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) and Sea Level) are releasing _Rule 42_ - brewed with all English hops (**Challenger**, **Phoenix**, and **Bramling Cross**), the beer was named after the the boat-racing rule (stating that only the wind and water can be used to increased, decrease, or maintain a craft's speed). It clocks in at 5.3% and 50 IBUs. As for the "North" team ([Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/), [Good Robot](http://wroughtironbrewing.ca/), [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/), and [Uncle Leo’s](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/)), their_ Northern Bight_ was brewed with plenty of Crystal 120 L for colour, and to boost the "spicy body". Hopped entirely with **UK Goldings** in the boil, and dry-hopped with... well, that's a secret, and we can't tell you! This 6.3% ABV, 60 IBUs ale was fermented with Nottingham, a dry English yeast. May the best beer win! No tickets are necessary to come take part in the fun, and there will be plenty of other NS Craft Beer on tap as well to celebrate the event. These two beers will then be available for growler fills at their participant breweries, and on tap at bars around the province.

• With their opening day getting closer and closer, [Upstreet Craft Brewing](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) has announced details on their first three beer releases. The first is _Commons Pilsner;_ brewed in the [Bohemian](http://bjcp.org/2008styles/style02.php#1b) style, the beer was named after its birthplace - in the 18th century, the brewery location used to be known as the "Commons", or the outskirts of Charlottetown proper. Fermented with a lager yeast strain, this Czech-style beer is brewed with real Czech ingredients, including Bohemian floor-malted pilsner malt, and lots of Czech **Saaz** hops (with plenty being added late in the boil to increase the spicy aroma/flavour indicative to the style). Coming in at 4.5% ABV and 35 IBUs, this "balanced and crisp" Lager is the perfect style for summer-drinking!

•  Next up is an American Pale Ale named in honor of all those who helped the brewery come to fruition... _Do-Gooder APA_. Proudly brewed using 50% Maritime Malt, it features a malty backbone and medium bitterness, with a blast of citrus and fruitness in the aroma, thanks to hop bursting (adding most of the hops very late in the boil). Something to satisfy the hopheads but also accessible for those who don't think they like hoppy or bitter beers. The Do-Gooder weighs in at 5.5% ABV and 45 IBUs. And we've heard a rumour about a Belgian-inspired fruit beer to be revealed shortly!

• [Sea Level](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) has released their returning summer seasonal, _Summer Blonde Pilsner_. Brewed with 100% Maritime Malt, this "crisp, refreshing" Lager is hopped with the aptly-named Australian variety, **Summer**. Coming in at a sessionable 4.8% ABV, the beer finishes with a fairly-firm bitterness, at 40 IBUs. You can find it at the brewery now for growler fills and can purchases; look for it at private liquor stores across Halifax, soon.

• The folks behind [Lake of Bays](http://www.lakeofbaysbrewing.ca/), a craft brewery from Baysville, ON, are coming to New Brunswick, and there will be a a series of beer dinners to celebrate:

In Fredericton, the Lake of Bays' owners will be dropping by the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) on May 27th, and Chef Aaron Fraser will be putting together a four course meal to pair with their offerings. The beers will be _Rock Cut Lager_, _Crosswind Pale Ale_, S_park House Red Ale_, _10 Point IPA_, _Old North Mocha Porter_, and a special Cask beer brewed for the event. Tickets will be going on sale very soon, keep on eye on the KSAH [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kingstreetalehouse) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KingStreetAle) feeds for details.

In Moncton, they are partnering with the  [Moncton Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/MonctonBeerLeague) and local [Chefs Dan & Cheryl McLenaghan](http://infuzedcatering.ca/) for an event at [La Teraz](http://www.lateraz.com/index.php?lang=en), on May 28th. A four course menu will be paired with four different Lake of Bays beer, plus a few others, and a souvenir glass. The dinner begins at 7:30 (doors at 6:30), and [tickets are available now](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/lake-of-bays-craft-beer-dinner-tickets-16984052759). The last Moncton Beer League dinner sold out well before the event, so don't delay! Early bird tickets are available until May 20th for a $10 savings, ticket sales close May 23rd. Sales from this event will help support the [Humanity Project](http://thehumanityproject.com/). Keep up with the event on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/1585643801704424/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MctnBeerDinner).

• [The Brewnettes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/769722406415310/) and [Beerthief Artisanal and Craft Beer Club](http://www.beerthief.ca/) are putting on a tasting of [Evil Twin](http://eviltwin.dk/) beers next Thursday at the [Quidi Vidi Brewery](http://www.quidividibrewery.ca/). Starting at 7:30, attendees will have a chance to taste four beers from this Danish gypsy brewery: _Low Life Pilsner_, _Freudian Slip Barleywine_, _I Love You With My Stout Imperial Stout_, and _Molotov Cocktail Imperial IPA_. Pretzels and hummus will be provided, and the Quidi Vidi bar will be open throughout the event. To reserve your spot, please do so [via email](mailto:havajavakayla@gmail.com) before Tuesday. This is a members only event, but membership is free, and open to all beer-loving women in Newfoundland.

• Sunday's [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) Open was a great event, with a dozen breweries and homebrewers competing in a blind tasting, with attendees voting on their favourite Backyard BBQ beers. The competition was fierce, with the winning beer revealed around 7pm. And, believe it or not, our very own Chris McDonald was the winner! He brewed a Lemon & Ginger Witbier on the pilot system at Good Robot, and the crowd seemed to enjoy the combination of lemon aroma with ginger spice and "snap". [Tatamagouche's](http://tatabrew.com/) _Sunrise Trail Session Ale_,  Boxing Rock's _Sessionista_, and Big Spruce's _Silver Tart_ all finished extremely close in the voting, with less than 0.5 points (out of 40) separating the top four. We're looking forward to next year's event already!

•  The event also served as the launching pad for a few new beers in our region,  [Propeller Brewing's](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) latest One Hit Wonder, _The S'Wheat Life_. This 4.5% ABV Wheat Beer is light in bitterness, at 10 IBUs, and is available now at both the Dartmouth and Gottingen breweries for growler fills. [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) released _Le Saison Froide_, a Saison brewed with Mint, Japanese Tea, and Lime, weighing in at 4.2% ABV, and will be available shortly at the brewery for growler fills. They have also released the next in their "Pucker Up" series, _Apricot Saison_, and their _Sugar Moon Maple_ will be available at the brewery this weekend. And as mentioned above, Big Spruce's _Silver Tart_ is now available for growler fills, and select bars across the province. They used 125 pounds of raspberries to achieve the wonderful flavour and striking colour, and used _Lactobacillus_ bacteria to achieve the acidic character of the beer. A little more on the background [here](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/03/27/friday-wrap-up-20150327/).

Have a fabulous long weekend... it's looking like some nice weather, so get out there and enjoy it with some local craft beer! The seasonal [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) _Weizen_ (~5.2% ABV) is back on tap at the brewpub, and is also available for growler fills at all four ANBL growler stations this weekend. The [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/) Tap Takeover continues into the weekend at [Tom's Little Havana](http://tomslittlehavana.wix.com/cafe), and includes two brand new beers, _Honey Wagon Honey Pale Ale_,_ Tom's Smoked Porter_, and returning favourites _Mosaic DIPA_, _Box Cutter IPA_ and _APA_. The [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) _Maritime Pale Ale_ (more info [here](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/05/01/friday-wrap-up-20150501/)) is now pouring at the brewery for both growler fills and on-site consumption. Those behind the [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) have been hinting at an upcoming Canada Day event; all we know at the moment is that it will be a smaller, exclusive event, but we'll have more info on that (and other plans up their sleeves) very soon! The [SmartBrew](http://www.smartbrew.com/) system at the [Nook & Cranny ](http://thenookandcranny.ca/)is in place, and they are fermenting their Wheat Ale, IPA and Pale Ale now. And homebrewers, today is the last day to register and drop off your entries for the [Brewnosers Homebrew Competition](http://www.brewnosers.org/competition/) at your local [Noble Grape](http://noblegrape.ca/).
