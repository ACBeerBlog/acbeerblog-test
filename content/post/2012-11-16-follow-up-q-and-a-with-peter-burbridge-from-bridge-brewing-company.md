This past March I posted and a [Q & A with Peter Burbridge ](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/q-a-with-peter-burbridge-from-bridge-brewing-company/)who was working towards opening Bridge Brewing Co.  Things are progressing well and Peter is hoping to open his new brewery next month.  Peter recently took a short break from renovating and brewing to answer a few additional questions:

Atlantic Canada Beer Blogger (ACBB): What is the address of the location of the brewery?
**Peter Burbridge (PB): 2576 Agricola St.**

ACBB: What is your target opening date?
**PB: ****We are hoping to be open in December if all goes well.  We are working hard to finish the renovations to the facade and the storefront.**

ACBB: Are you planning any other beers other than the Yardstick Ale for the opening?
**PB:  Yes, we are brewing our interpretation of a Farmhouse Ale, which will be on tap at the Brooklyn Warehouse.  We are also brewing a Belgian Blond for Gus' pub across the street from us. Gus' is the second oldest bar in Halifax, so we are quite excited to do a co-branded beer with them.**


ACBB: Are you still planning on selling via 660 mL bomber bottles, kegging and growlers?
**PB:  ****Yes, that is still the plan.  We won't be doing any bottling initially, but plan to start bottling within a month or two of opening.**

ACBB: Do you have any keg accounts signed up that you would like to share?
**PB:  Yes, we have accounts with the [Brooklyn Warehouse](http://www.brooklynwarehouse.ca/BWSite.Nov.1.a.12/Home.html) and Gus' pub.  We will also be on tap at [ Mother's Pizza](http://www.motherspizzacanada.com/) once that opens on Young and Agricola.  **

ACBB: Any other information you'd like to pass along?
**PB: Just that we are getting really excited for the launch and can't wait to get our beers out there!**
