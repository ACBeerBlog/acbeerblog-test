_Note: Unfortunately, Bridge Brewing from Halifax will NOT be at the festival. Owner Peter Burbridge has said that due to high demand for their beers in Halifax, they will not have the time to attend. Hopefully, next time!_

_Update: Looks like Sea Level Brewing will also NOT be coming to the festival due to selling out of their beer this past week. Like Bridge Brewing, we look forward to seeing them at the next beer festival, whenever that may be!_

**• Prince Edward Island:**

- PEI Brewing Co - 1772 IPA, Iron Bridge _(formerly Iron Horse)_, Sir John A's Honey Wheat, Island Red, Beach Chair Lager, and Blueberry Ale

The beers being served by the breweries in the other provinces can be viewed on the festival's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash). Have a great time, you lucky ticket-holders! And remember... hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!
