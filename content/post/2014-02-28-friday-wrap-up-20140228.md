Happy Friday, everyone! Today also marks the last day of February. Wow, time flies when you're having fun/beer! Lots of beer news for you this week, so let's dive right in!

• As part of next weekend's [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/), there is a separate fundraiser going on, to benefit the Fest's charity, [Team Diabetes](http://www.diabetes.ca/get-involved/supporting-us/team-diabetes/). Check out the [Golden Growler Auction](https://www.facebook.com/events/247260335456739)! There are only twenty of these snazzy Golden Growlers available, screenprinted with the list of breweries and suppliers attending the 2014 FCBF. To win one, you must put in your bid before 11:59PM on Friday, March 7th. The twenty highest bids will get a growler (sorry, not full, but it can be filled down the street at the [Picaroons Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons)), as well as a charitable donation receipt. What a no-brainer! If you're not on Facebook, you can also submit your bids via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FrederictonBeer) and [email](mailto:FrederictonBeer<at>gmail.com). Right now, the minimum bid to win is somewhere around $30, so don't be shy! Be sure to mention how many growlers you'd like, as you can bid in multiples, as well. If you won't be able to pick up the growler at the Fest, they will make arrangements to get it to you.

• After a little break for the holidays and New Year, the [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/) is back with another great event! They will be hosting a screening of [_Beer Hunter: the movie_](http://www.beerhuntermovie.com/index.php), about the life of [Michael Jackson](http://www.beerhunter.com/), at [Lion & Bright Cafe & Wine Bar](https://www.facebook.com/lionandbright) in Halifax, 7pm March 25th. Your $15 movie ticket also gets you some tasty popcorn, and a pint of a special cask of [Uncle Leo's](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/) beer (unsure which of their beers it is, yet). Tickets are only available online, and in short supply, so [buy yours today](https://etixnow.com/events/ladies-beer-league-mar-25)! The movie will actually be introduced and attended by some people who had the opportunity to meet and work with Michael during his career. Sounds like a great date night to me, and there will also be a limited number of copies of the film for sale after, for future viewings. As with all LBL events, _everyone_ is welcome! And be sure to check out LBL's new [website](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/), with an FAQ, and the future possibility of purchasing a membership, which will give discounts at local establishments.

• The Parcel of Rogues that [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) brewed up for the 25th Anniversary of the Lunar Rogue is back. This time, in addition to being on tap at the Rogue, it will also be available for growler fills at the Brewtique. And don't forget, if you're in the Fredericton area tomorrow (March 1), Picaroons is having the official launch of their Maple Cream Ale at the [York St. Train Station](http://www.nbliquor.com/station.html), with free food, beer samples, and music, from 11 am - 3 pm.

• As their official launch date gets ever closer, the people over at [Les Brasseurs du Petit Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) have started a countdown to opening, estimating at about 95 days. They're making leeway in the process, as they've already chosen the names of their flagship beers (a Belgian Blonde and Witbier... no, they're not revealing the names yet!), are testing brewing recipes at the NBCC in Grand-Sault, and preparing to have some tastings of their first batch within the next few weeks. Their building is also taking shape quite nicely, with their brewing equipment expected within a month.

• The[ Pump House Brewery](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) in Moncton is looking to add to their brewing team! They've posted a job listing [here](http://discussions.probrewer.com/showthread.php?36195-A-east-coast-brewery-is-looking-for-an-experienced-brewer-to-become-part-of-our-team&p=110546#post110546), looking for someone to fill the position of Head Brewer and add to their brewing talent. Check out the link for the full job requirements; they are looking for someone with 5-15 years of brewing experience. If you're interested in responding to the posting, you can send them an [email](mailto:accounting<at>pumphousebrewery.ca).

• For those of you living on PEI who are entering the 1st Annual Homebrewer's Challenge (we originally posted on the event [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/02/14/friday-wrap-up-20140214/)), those at the [Gahan House](http://www.gahan.ca/) have decided to change some of the dates in order to give homebrewers sufficient time to brew their beer. The registration deadline was last Friday, but those registered now have until 5:00 pm, Friday April 4th to pass in their six-pack to the Gahan House. The preliminary judging and other events noted in our post will then be held over the next week, with the judging of the top 5 entries taking place on Saturday, April 12th.

• [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) in Nyanza is hosting a special guest brewer in the brewhouse today: Aaron Spinney, head brewer at [Sawdust City](http://sawdustcitybeer.blogspot.ca/), in Gravenhurst, ON. They are brewing a big Wheat IPA (You Spin Me White Round Wheat IPA), weighing in around 6.5-7% ABV and with 70 IBUs, and will have loads of dry hopping. The big wheat component will give a different mouthfeel and head from normal IPAs; the beer should be a great addition to the lineup. Aaron has some connections to the Bras d'Or Lake area, so brewing with Jeremy and crew at Big Spruce was a no-brainer! Be sure to follow along with the fun on [Big Spruce's](https://twitter.com/BigSpruceBrew) and [Aaron's](https://twitter.com/SawdustSpinney) Twitter accounts for up-to-the-minute details.

• More great news for Big Spruce: In order to keep up with the growing demand for their beer both on and off Cape Breton Island, they got several fermentors and conditioning tanks on the way from [DME](http://www.dmebrewing.ca/) in PEI. Two 10 bbl fermentors are scheduled to arrive within the next week, and a third will be through the doors shortly thereafter. And then in late spring, they will be adding two more conditioning tanks to the brewery. This will allow them to increase production by about 70%, in order to keep their head above water during the busy summer to come. This will mean some shuffling of things around the brewery, and construction of the _Sprucetique_, where visitors will be able to sit and enjoy a paddle of samples while deciding which to purchase in a growler, while enjoying their beautiful view of the Bras d'Or lake. All this after just one year of brewing and selling beer! Congrats to Jeremy and the Big Spruce crew, and thanks to you for drinking it!

• Another busy week at [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) in Halifax, punctuated with a home brewing flavour: Last Saturday, the first round of judging was performed in this year's Home Brew Off competition. Seventy-six homebrewed Weizens were judged by a panel of 10 BJCP-certified judges (acbbchris was among them), narrowing down the field to a top 13 best beers. This week, that lucky thirteen was further reduced down to a final four of beer awesomeness, by Brewmaster Daniel Girard and his crew. Those four beers will be further tasted and tested (again by certified judges), and the winning beer will be crowned the 2014 Home Brew Off Winner! 2013's Home Brew Off winner, Peter Welton, was in the brewery for a long day Monday, in order to brew his Belgian Blonde. This beer will be released at the Gala event, March 13th. The beer name is a closely guarded secret (only revealed at the Gala), but we can tell you that the beer will weigh in at 7.5% ABV and 24 IBUs.

• [The Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) in Halifax is inviting [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) for today's Firkin Friday, and Propeller has answered the call with a cask of Black IPA, dry hopped with Simcoe! They brewed up a special batch of this beer specially for the Goat, and will be releasing a full batch in the spring, so be sure to grab a pint. As always, the casks are tapped at 4pm, and once it's gone, it's gone, so best to get there promptly.

• A quick reminder that [Beerthief](http://www.beerthief.ca) Offering #10 from [Brooklyn Brewery](http://brooklynbrewery.com/) closes Sunday, March 2nd. Check the full details [here](http://www.beerthief.ca/beer-offerings/offering-10-brooklyn-brewery), but the quick summary is that members can order East India Pale Ale, Brooklyn Pennant, Local 1, Local 2 or Sorachi Ace beers, to be delivered at their local NLC. As always, [contact Tom](mailto:tom.beckett<at>nl.rogers.com) to place your order.

• In other Beerthief news, on Sunday March 16, there will be a combination tasting and presentation about their March 2015 River Cruise to the Netherlands and Belgium. There will be an assortment of excellent Belgian beers served (including Saison Dupont to start), and the presentation will go over the itinerary and beer specifics of the cruise. Mike Buhler will be part of the planning process of the cruise, and will be leading the tasting (both on the 16th, and during the cruise). Seating for the presentation/tasting is very limited, so reserve your spot [with Tom](mailto:tom.beckett<at>nl.rogers.com) today!

• [Rogues Roost Brewpub](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) in Halifax has released their latest seasonal, a Porter. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get all of the recipe details before press time, but we can assure you it will be worth a visit!

• And finally, coming back to the Fredericton Craft Beer Festival, we're having a contest for you to win two VIP tickets to the sold-out event! Starting today, take a picture of a beer brewed by any of the breweries that will be at the festival (check out the full list [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/02/12/fredericton-craft-beer-festival-saturday-march-8th-at-the-fredericton-convention-centre/)), and tweet it or share it to the [FCBF Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonCraftBeerFestival), with the hashtag #FCBF14. The contest will run until next Thursday, March 6th, at 11:59 pm; the lucky winner will be announced in next week's Friday Wrap-Up. Extra points for creativity! And if you already have tickets to the fest, feel free to still participate; the FCBF will refund the cost of your 2 VIP tickets if you win!

Have a fantastic weekend, everyone!
