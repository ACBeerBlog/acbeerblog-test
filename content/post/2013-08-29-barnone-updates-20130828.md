It's been a few months since the official opening of PEI's [BarNone Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing), so we wanted to provide a couple of updates. We contacted Brewmaster Don Campbell, and he was able to pass along the following information:








	
  * Tonight, as part of their regular Growler Thursday (6-8pm at the brewery, located at [4248 Route 225 in Rose Valley](http://goo.gl/maps/gkCR7)), there will be samples of two Pale Ales available, for your tasting and voting pleasure. Don has made a couple of changes to the newest batch, and is looking for feedback from the public, so now's the time to make a visit to the brewery. He will have anonymous voting cards and a drop box, so don't worry if you aren't a Beer Judge, all feedback is welcome! The Summer Session beer will also be available in growler to go.



	
  * It is almost time for Hop Harvest in Rose Valley, which they plan on doing this weekend. So if you wanted a chance to galavant through the hop fields, tonight's the night, as they will be gone by next Thursday. We're unsure what the plans are for the hops, as Don is being quiet with exact details, but I'm sure he's got something special planned for them, as they're grown just metres from the brewery.



	
  * If you can't make it out to Rose Valley to pick up a growler, BarNone is also available at several PEI bars and restaurants, including [The Landing](http://thelandingpei.com/) in Tyne Valley, [Cedar's Restaurant and Baba's Lounge](http://www.cedarseatery.com/), and [The Old Triangle](http://www.oldtrianglecharlottetown.com/welcome/), in Charlottetown. Want to see it on tap at another favourite bar, be sure to ask for it!



	
  * BarNone will the attending the [Kegs, Corks, and Oysters](http://www.fallflavours.ca/calendar/56/4684-Kegs-Corks-Oysters) festival taking place in Summerside on Sept. 21. It is a celebration of Malpeque oysters, paired with great local beer and wine. In addition to serving beer samples, we understand some of it will be used in a special beef and oyster hand pie.
