We’re firmly into 2017 and we’ll all hopefully be able to stop typing 2016 any day now. Though the we haven’t quite reached the dead of winter, the beer scene in the region is still showing plenty of signs of life and it’s not looking like that will slow down any time soon. Read on for all the news on new beers, re-releases, and beer- and brewery-related events throughout our corner of the country. And don't forget, the first kegs from Harvey, NB's [Think Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/thinkbrewing) will be available this weekend. We have confirmation that they will be on tap at the [James Joyce Pub](https://www.facebook.com/theJamesJoycePubFredericton/) and [540 Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/540kitchenandbar) in the next day or two. To learn more, check out [Tuesday's Profile](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/01/17/think-brewing-harvey-nb/) with Think. And now on to the rest of the beer news!

• A little over a year ago, [Flying Boats](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710) released _Double Oatmeal Stout_, an easy-drinking beer with plenty of oatmeal and roast character. Recently, owner/brewer Marc Melanson has changed the recipe, with the result being _Station Master Stout_. Over 10% of rolled oats, along with specialty malts including Chocolate and Roasted varieties, makes up the grist, giving "slight chocolate, coffee, and roastiness" in the flavour, along with a full-bodied mouthfeel. Hopped with **East Kent Goldings** to 28 IBUs, expect this one to weigh in at approximately 5.2% ABV; look for it at Flying Boats tap accounts sometime within the next couple of weeks.

• Saint John's newest brewery, [Loyalist City](http://loyalistcitybrewing.ca), released another of their flagship beers for the first time late last week. An American Pale Ale, _Three Sisters Pale Ale_ (6% ABV, 60 IBUs) features a blend of three popular American hop varieties - **Centennial**, **Citra** and **Mosaic** - to give "an assertive mix of citrus and tropical fruit flavor and aroma". The high majority of the hops were added in the whirlpool, after the boil was complete, to maximize the deliciousness of these varieties, without adding too much bitterness in the finish. The grist was kept simple, with a mix of two base malts, to complement the hops but not overpower them. Fermented clean with an American Ale yeast strain, more Mosaic was included in not one, but two, dry-hop additions, resulting in even more tropical fruit in the aroma. For historians, the beer was named after the Three Sisters Lamp, which was erected in 1842 at the end of Prince William Street "to welcome visitors to the Saint John Harbour by guiding them safely into port". Look for _Three Sisters_ on tap at select accounts in the city, including [Cask & Kettle](http://caskandkettle.com/) and [Five & Dime](http://fiveanddimesj.com/), and at the [ANBL Growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) program starting Jan 26 at the three SJ-region locations. Details are thin, but look for LCBC's _Extra Special Bitter_ to hit the taps this weekend, we'll share more details when we have them.

• [YellowBelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in downtown St John's has released a new cider this week, featuring partridge berries. Twenty kilograms of the extremely ripe fruit were used for a subtle sweetness and tannic tartness. From Brewmaster Liam McKenna, "It's like our regular cider with a bit of pink lemonade and the merest hint of wintergreen, methinks." Grab a pint at the pub, and look for bottles at a few [St. John's NLCs](http://nlliquor.com/search/searchresults?&lcid=9&q=YellowBelly) next week.

• Still on the Rock, [Mill Street Brewpub](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) has been serving a beer since late 2016 that we seem to have missed the boat on. _St. John’s ESB_ is in the English Pale Ale family, with a balance of hop bitterness and malt sweetness enhancing its drinkability. It comes in at a very reasonable 4.8% ABV and 27 IBU with biscuit, caramel and lightly toasted malt notes and floral and earthy hop flavours. Look for it the next time you’re by for a pint or a growler fill.​

• Fans of Moncton's [Bore City Brewing](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/) can look forward to their first new beer release in a while, a currently-unnamed "lower-ABV Belgian style Ale" (think roughly along the lines of an Abbey Single or Table Beer). With a grist of mainly Pilsner malt and Munich II, it was hopped with **East Kent Goldings** and **Hallertau Blanc**, and fermented with a Belgian yeast strain, [White Labs' Belgian Golden Ale](http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-bank/wlp570-belgian-golden-ale-yeast). This one should come in around 5.6% ABV; it won't be ready for another few weeks, according to the brewery, but we'll have more information to release before then!

• [Graystone Brewing](http://graystonebrewing.com/) has their first Lager on tap at their taproom and elsewhere in Fredericton. _The North_ is a Pilsner that was "amply hopped" with two varieties, German **Perle** and Czech** Saaz**, giving distinctive floral and spicy notes to the beer. Fermented cool at 13 C with a European Lager yeast, the beer was further lagered at cold temperatures for six weeks. It clocks in at 5.3% ABV and 40 IBUs, and is available now for pints, and crowler/growler fills.

• Graystone also released another new beer yesterday, _Shiver Stout_, to coincide with this year's [Shivering Songs Festival](http://www.shiveringsongs.com/). With an addition of a cold-brewed medium roast blend from [Whitney Coffee Company](http://www.whitneycoffee.com/) added directly to the beer, there's plenty of smooth coffee flavour (without any harshness) in this one. On the lighter-ABV end for a stout (4.7%), it clocks in at 30 IBUs; while exploring around Fredericton for the festival, be sure to seek this one out!

• Continuing with Fredericton, [Bogtrotter](https://www.facebook.com/BogtrotterCraftBrewery/) has a new beer popping up around the city. _Drunken Newt Red Rye Ale_ was brewed with Rye malt in the grist, with nutmeg added late in the boil. This deep red-coloured beer comes in at 5% ABV, and features "aromas of fresh rye bread, caramel malt and hops", according to the brewery. Expect flavours of caramel, toffee, and a hint of, naturally, nutmeg. It's available on tap around Fredericton, and is also in 500 mL bottles at the York St. and Oromocto ANBL locations.

• Now firmly in the middle of winter, it's time for the return of one of last year's favourites, [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/)'s _Coade Word: Snowmaggedon_, an ode to local meteorologist [Peter Coade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Coade), who retired in September 2016, after a record-breaking 54 year career. This Winter Warmer is 7.4% ABV, and features Gila Squash grown at their brewery farm. It was oven roasted with organic cane sugar before being added to the mash, extracting some extra sweetness and complexity. After primary fermentation, the beer was conditioned with a dark rum tincture of local ginger with organic cinnamon and vanilla. This release is draft/growler only, while the next release will be aged in barrels and will be available on draft, and in bottles.

• Mahone Bay's [Saltbox Brewing](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) has released their first Double IPA, _Make and Break_. Clocking in at 7.5% ABV, the beer features **Amarillo **and **Millennium** hops, to the tune of 60 IBUs, balancing the sweet, malty aroma. Grab a pint or growler fill at the brewery, and look for it at their tap accounts shortly.

• Be sure to grab today's episode of the [902 BrewCast](http://www.902brewcast.com/), with Kyle, Phil, and Tony tasting through a selection of Nova Scotian and New Brunswick IPAs (including a look at the medal winners of the 2016 ACBAs). They even invited along our very own acbbchris for a nerdier approach to the whole thing. Be sure to share your feedback on their [social](http://www.twitter.com/902BrewCast) [media](https://www.facebook.com/902brewcast) [feeds](https://www.instagram.com/902brewcast/), or in a comment below.

• Attention large AtlCan breweries! The [Canadian Trade Commissioner Service](http://tradecommissioner.gc.ca/) is taking a handful of Canadian breweries on a tour of five US cities next month, and the opportunity to sign-up is now open. Visiting Denver, Minneapolis, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami Feb 27 - Mar 2, brewers will have the chance to meet local vendors, check out the potential markets, and learn about the benefits (and potential) drawbacks to doing business abroad. [More details can be found here](http://tradecommissioner.gc.ca/united-states-of-america-etats-unis-amerique/events-evenements/0003218.aspx?lang=eng), including contacts on how to sign up before the application window closes January 25th.

**A few events have popped up on our radar; check out what's happening in your neck of the woods:**

• Moncton's [Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) are holding another [Growler Pop-Up](https://www.facebook.com/events/367703516939093) **today**, 10-6pm (or when the beer runs dry). Look for the return of _Herbies Oatmeal for Breakfast_ Stout, _Sour Otis Fruit Cake_ Kettle Sour, as well as two new IPAs: _Calling Method_ IPA (featuring **Citra**) and _Nelson_ IPA, single-hopped with **Nelson Sauvin**. The first few folks through the door will receive a free T&B growler (empty) - the early birds get the worm!

• A reminder of **tomorrow's** [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) Tap Takeover at [Ducky's](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar) in Sackville.

• It’s a ways away on **May 27th**, but early bird tickets are already on sale for the first annual [Yarmouth Craft Beer Festival](http://www.yarmouthcraftbeer.com/).

• The YBF will also feature the first annual Hop Run. This event marries drinking beer and running and features both individual and relay formats. Individuals will run between 1 and 3 miles, with a beer at the starting gun and another after each mile completed to a maximum of three laps and four beers per person.

- [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) _Carbon-14_ is back, Professor Jason MacDougall's second-place winner from the first Boxing Rock Black Box challenge last year is available once again. It's a big beer, a strong dark Belgian that should be perfect for a cold winter night.
