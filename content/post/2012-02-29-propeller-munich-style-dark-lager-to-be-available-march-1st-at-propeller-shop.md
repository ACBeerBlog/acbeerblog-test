[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/propeller-dark.png?w=257)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/propeller-dark.png)This past February Propeller Brewery started offering up one off brews on the first of the month in a limited release.  These beers will be available in growlers only at the Prop Shop on 2015 Gottingen St. Halifax.

The second in the series, available this coming Thursday, is Munich Style Dark Lager.  Check out the [What's New section of the Propeller site](http://drinkpropeller.ca/content/content_Media) for a description of the beer and history of the style.
