Another week, another fresh batch of beer news to get you up to speed! Let's go!

• After announcing plans to start brewing on-site in late November, [Mama's Pub](http://www.mamaspubwesthills.com/) on [Brookside](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mama's+Pub+West+Hills/@45.9919336,-66.684633,13z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x4ca418563bf496ed:0xb4362262d83ff10e!2s500+Brookside+Dr,+Fredericton,+NB+E3A+8V2,+Canada!3b1!3m1!1s0x4ca4185637608de1:0x9ae4d8884f7d4700) will officially have beer for sale starting tonight! Brewer Ryan Kingston has all three of their first flagship brews ready for consumption: _Mama's Golden Ale_, a 5% ABV, 17 IBUs pale ale that is "light, crisp, and really easy to drink"; _Mama's Session IPA_, a 4.2% ABV, 23 IBUs ale, dry-hopped with **Comet** and **Citra**; and _Mama's Vanilla Bean Stout_, a 5.7%, 19 IBUs dark beer with "tons of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla notes", featuring real vanilla beans that were pre-soaked in Kahlúa liqueur prior to being added to the fermentor. These beers will currently be available only at Mama's Pub for pints, so drop in to give them a try, and be sure to check out the brewery behind the new 9x6 window in the restaurant! **UPDATE:** Unfortunately, Mama's has let us know that the beers will NOT be pouring tonight as originally planned; look for them to be available sometime next week.

• This weekend, [Flying Boats](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710) is launching a special one-off IPA for Valentine's Day. _Lovers Quarrel IPA_ came to be thanks to a short in the heating element of the brewery's electric brew panel; after over two hours of troubleshooting, brewer/owner Marc Melanson decided to change his brewing plans and concoct something new. The beer was bittered with **Columbus**, with several late additions of **Chinook** and **Cascade**; dry-hopped with **Amarillo** and **Centennial**, expect aromas and flavours of dank, citrus, and tropical fruit. Weighing in at 6.4% ABV and 76 IBUs, look for this one on tap at select accounts, including [Ducky's](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar) in Sackville, and Fredericton's [James Joyce Pub](https://www.facebook.com/The-James-Joyce-Pub-187205728006725/?fref=ts).

• Speaking of beers perfect for Love Day, [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) just launched their third seasonal brew: _Cocoa Envy_, a Robust Chocolate Porter. With fresh cocoa nibs from the U.S., coffee beans from Costa Rica, and a hint of added cinnamon, this complex brew should be just what you need to get you in the mood... to have another. Available now for growler fills and at select Breton accounts; 6.5 % ABV and 37 IBUs.

• There's a new beer on tap at the [YellowBelly](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) brewpub, a 5.3% ABV British Pale Ale named _Landsmen_. Featuring a simple grist of Maris Otter and Dark Crystal malt, it was hopped solely with Brewer's Gold to ~50 IBUs; two dry-hop additions were made to allow its "earthy, spicy, and berry fruit character to shine", according to the brewery. Grab it on tap at the pub/restaurant today, and in bottles to go next week, as well as on NLC shelves.

• [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301)'s Patrice Godin has made another trip to Edmundston, which is good news for all of us... it means that there's another collaboration beer in the works with [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/)! While we aren't privy to the name yet, we can give you some other details on this strong, dark and malty lager: it should come in at about 7.5% ABV and 23 IBUs, and will feature "bready, chewy malt flavours with hints of chocolate and dark fruit, along with a slight nuttiness from toasted buckwheat", according to Petit-Sault. Cold-conditioned, or lagered, for six weeks to help smooth out the flavours further, this one should be ready sometime in early April. It should be available on tap AND in bottles, for a limited time; we'll keep you updated on its progress!

• In other Petit-Sault news, their annual brew day on March 5th for the [Pink Boots Society](http://pinkbootssociety.org/big-boots-brew/) is approaching fast, and ladies, they need your help! Led by Petit-Sault brewer Julie Long, the style being brewed is a "Honey Rye Ale"; two other currently-unindentified women will be helping with the brew, and they're accepting volunteers for the fourth and final team member! If you're interested in participating, send an email to the brewery's own [Mychèle Poitras](mailto:mychele@petitsault.com). The winner will be chosen randomly on Feb 19th.

• [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) recently acquired some new yeast strains from a Canadian yeast lab, [Escarpment Laboratories](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/), located in Guelph, ON. Stephen Dixon of Grimross has been wanting to do a Saison fermented with _Brettanomyces_, a "wild" strain that is well-known for the funky, fruity, barnyard characteristics it imparts in beer. Several strains were ordered, including variations of their "New World Saison Blend", which contains both a _Brett_ strain and _Saccharomyces_ strain. If Dixon is happy with the results, he plans to continue to harvest and repitch the yeast, allowing the culture to evolve into a Grimross house blend. The first beer brewed will also feature local hops from [Southan Farms](http://www.southanfarms.net/). We'll be sure to keep track of this interesting experiment!

• Moncton's newest brewery, [Bore City](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/), has released their third flagship beer, a 6% ABV American Porter named _Spacetime Odyssey_. Brewed with dark roast coffee and hopped with the super-tropical, Australian variety **Galaxy**, you can expect an interesting blend of roasted, coffee flavours, along with the fruitiness from the hops... if you can find some. Two kegs were sent to [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/) on Monday, and there was a bit still available last night, so we suggest heading there today for lunch to finish it off. In doing so, you'll help to bring BC's next been on tap, **Marécage**, their Belgian-style Saison. At 7% ABV, it features a yeast-driven palate of cloves and spices, with a bit of pepper taste to finish. Again, we expect these to be drained quickly, but don't worry though, more Bore City beer is on its way, and may find its way to Fredericton in the near future.

• We have some details on the collaboration beer brewed between [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) and [Bar Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/), _Englishish_, which is being described as an "English-ish Golden Ale". While the beer features a simple malt profile and is low in bitterness, it "draws inspiration from the aromatic North American Pale Ales that we love" according to Tata brewer Christiane Jost, as plenty of English variety hops were added (**Fuggles** and **East Kent Goldings**) to give earthy, floral and spicy aromas. British hops, American malt and brewing technique = "English-ish". Easy-drinking at 4.5% ABV, it will make its debut this Sunday during the Tatabrew tap-takeover event at Stillwell for Valentine's Day ([a few tickets are still available](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/valentines-day-w-tatamagouche-brewing-stillwell-tickets-21135225027)), with cans to follow sometime next week.

• [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) will soon be celebrating their 2nd Anniversary, and they have a big announcement to do it in style... they're opening a new Ciderhouse in the near future! Details are being kept under wraps for now, but we can tell you that the new location will still be located within Fredericton, and will provide an outlet "unlike any other in New Brunswick", according to owner/brewer Adam Clawson. Stay tuned for more, soon!

• Tomorrow at 5 pm, [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery) is holding a Mediterranean/African food and beer pairing [event](https://www.facebook.com/events/219081531765026/) at the brewery/B&B in Nackawic. Three courses of  Mediterranean and African fusion food will be paired with three Big Axe beers, with Red Rover cider, [Sunset Heights](https://www.facebook.com/SunsetHeightsMeadery) sparkling mead, and wine being offered at an additional cost. Tickets went on sale in late January and sold out in two days; however, there WILL be similar food and beer pairings at the brewery in the future, so keep your eyes on their Facebook page for announcements!

• It's been a busy week at Halifax's [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/)! With entry closing for the 8th Annual [Home Brew-Off](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/show/home-brew-off) yesterday, it was time for 2015 winner Dave Martin to brew up his winning beer. Martin joined Brew Master Daniel Girard and Head Brewer Jonathan Harris on Marginal Rd to put together _Mr Robusto_, last year's winning Robust Porter. It will be released at the gala party where this year's Experimental IPA winner will be crowned, March 3rd. Returning to the brewery this week is _Pucker Up_, a pink-hued pomegranate-hibiscus wheat beer. Joining it is a brand new brew, _Shack Wacky._ This 5.2% ABV Radler is built on an APA base, features loads of orange aroma and finish, along with hints of lemon and other citrus. This is another brewery-only product, for samples and growler fills.

• [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) have announced the details of their next in the series of beer events. **Beer Social** with [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) will be taking place next Sunday, February 21st. The Big Spruce himself, Jeremy White, will be in attendance and introducing the food and beer pairings for this four course meal. Among the beers pouring that day will be one of only four kegs of the just-released _Ra Ra Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout_, the 10.5% ABV Glenora barrel-aged beauty (remember, bottles will **only** be on sale at the Nyanza brewery, and there are not many available!). [Grab tickets for the Beer Social today](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/beer-social-with-big-spruce-tickets-21436789013)!

•[ BarNone](http://barnone.beer/) has released their latest in the "Sessions" series: _Vic's Secret Sessions _made its debut at Growler Night yesterday, featuring the dual-purpose Australian hop **Vic Secret**. At 4.8%ABV, this beer is low in alcohol, but big in flavour and aroma, perfect for an all-day session.

• There's another new style to try at [Spindrift](http://spindriftbrewing.com/) today, with their weekly **7th Wave** beer being a [Lichtenhainer](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2008/01/lichtenhainer.html). While there is some discussion as to whether traditional Lichtenhainers contained wheat, modern interpretations tend to be a hybrid of Berliner Weisse and Rauchbier, resulting in a tart, smoky, sessionable beer. Either way, it's a style rarely seen around these parts. Spindrift's _Lichtenhainer_ is a light 5%ABV and 15 IBUs. As with all of their 7th Wave brews, it will be on sale today at the brewery today at noon for growler fills only.

•[ Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) has introduced a "Glee Club" at the brewery and taproom. Members receive their own custom 18oz mug at the taproom (and receive larger pours at regular price), discounts on growler and grunter fills and merchandise, specials on their birthday, access to exclusive members-only events, and a chance to be a part of a brewday with Doug. [Registration is now open](http://wroughtironbrewing.ca/glee-club/) for this $100/yr club, and more details are available on their site.

• [Liquid Assets](https://www.facebook.com/LiquidAssetsNS), the NS beer, cider, wine, and spirits store opening this spring at the [Halifax Stanfield International Airport](http://hiaa.ca/), is hiring. Full- and part-time associates with knowledge of the local scene (or a thirst to learn), are encouraged to apply. The job skills include inventory control, customer assistance in choosing the right product, leading tastings, and everything in between. [The job posting is here](https://www.careerbeacon.com/posting/511494/liquid-assets/ns-wine-beer-spirits-store-associates/enfield/), and open until the end of the month. Construction at their storefront, located beyond security at the Airport, has begun, with an anticipated opening of April.

• For brewers (and potential ones) looking for insight into the "next step", [Springboard Atlantic](http://springboardatlantic.ca/) is hosting a **Liquid Courage** event at Acadia University next Thursday, February 18th. An event highlighting the potential partnerships available between the brewing and scientific community for quality control, taste panels, and R&D, as well as insights into exporting beyond provincial and national borders, from local successful businesses. It will feature presentations from brewers and wine makers, scientists and academics from across the Maritimes, and business development agencies to aid in making it all happen. [Registration is still open for the full day event](https://eventreg.acadiau.ca/events/rgs-liquid-courage-201602/).

Have a great beer- and love-filled weekend! Not because it's Valentine's Day, but just because! A few last news items...

- [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co/301456876447)'s _Sandpiper Pilsner_ is back on tap at the brewpub; a 5.5% ABV Bohemian Pilsner hopped with **Hallertau** and **Saaz** to 50 IBUs, it's available for both pints and growler fills while supplies last.
- [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has re-released _The Next Chapter_ Rye IPA; first brewed in 2015 with Andrew Estabrooks and released at last year's [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/), this brew is available now in bottles and growlers, and will be seeing release in New Brunswick.
- [North](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) is re-releasing their popular _Belgian Milk Stout_ today, after a long hiatus. The 5.0% ABV beer was out of rotation for a period, due to their expansion to Dartmouth through [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/), as well as the birth of Brewer Josh Herbin's child in the fall. Look for more special beers to be released in due time, now that the brewhouse has settled down.
- [PEI Brewing](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) has brought _Black Banks_ Black IPA back for another year. It is currently available at the brewery's taproom, and many PEILCC stores. It has also been sent to New Brunswick, and should be appearing on ANBL shelves in the next few days. [Check inventory here](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/ProductDetails/4998).
- Petit-Sault's _Canon Franchetti_, their Cappucino stout, is back, currently on tap and in bottles at the brewery, and will be pouring at ANBL growler stations next Friday, Feb 19th.
