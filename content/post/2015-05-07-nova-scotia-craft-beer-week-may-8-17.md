[![NSCraftBeerWeek Banner](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NSCraftBeerWeek-Banner.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NSCraftBeerWeek-Banner.jpg)

The Inaugural NS Craft Beer Week starts tomorrow. A presentation of the [Craft Brewers Association of Nova Scotia](http://nscraftbeer.ca/nscbw/), the aim of the week is to showcase the innovative products of its members, and collaborations with bars, restaurants and licensees. With so many different events to keep track of, we thought it would be beneficial to have them all in one place. But first, with all of these events going on over the coming days, we can expect to see several new beers (and some returning favourites) from many of the participating breweries. Here's a taste of what will be joining the many regular-release beers that will be pouring all week...

[Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/), [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) & [Tatamagouche...](http://tatabrew.com/)

These three breweries came together for a conspiracy of epic proportions.... _Cerberus _American IPA. This Certified Organic beer weighs in at 7% ABV, and features massive late additions of **Centennial**, **Amarillo**, **Simcoe** and **Zythos** hops for an assertive, but not offensive, aroma and flavour. It will be released Saturday at noon at Bar Stillwell in Halifax, as well as on tap for growler fills at each of the conspiring breweries. There will also be a very limited number of bottles available.

"South" and "North" Collaboration English IPAs

There will be two new English IPAs at the Race the Kegs event on Friday, May 15th at the Gahan House. Both are collaboration beers - one from the "South" team (Boxing Rock, Gahan House, Hell Bay and Sea Level), and one from the "North" (Big Spruce, Good Robot, Uncle Leo's and North Brewing). Details are mum on each of these beers for now; you'll have to attend the event that night to find out the differences yourself!

[Good Robot...](http://wroughtironbrewing.ca/)

Since Good Robot will be making their debut at NSCBW, all of their four beers are brand new! Here's a brief run-down of their opening offerings (and remember, all beers have had Clarityferm added to significantly reduce their gluten content):

_Goseface Killah_ (5% ABV, 11 IBUs) - Gose is a German style of beer that up until recently was extremely hard to find, but is gaining popularity quite quickly here in North America. A sour and tart ale brewed with coriander and salt water, and fermented with a Belgian Abbey yeast, expect a pale, tart, refreshing beer perfect for the approaching summer days!

_Tom Waits for No One_ (8.1% ABV, 55 IBUs) - This is their big, dark beer, a Stout brewed with plenty of dark malts (Chocolate, Black, and Carafa II) to add all of the roasted and chocolate goodness you expect from this style of beer. Fermented with an English yeast strain, with real chocolate and coffee added in secondary

_Burban Legend_ (5% ABV, 28 IBUs) - A Citrus American Pale Ale featuring several hop varieties (**Cascade**, **Falconer's Flight** and **Zythos**) to provide the "citrus" that you'd expect in a beer with this name. Along with 2-row, Pilsner, Amber and Crystal 30 L malts, they've also added some rye to "spice" things up a little bit.

_Crown on the Ground_ (4.3% ABV, 34 IBUs) - Good Robot's take on the Steam Beer, this amber-coloured brew is hopped differently than most takes on the style, featuring **Mt. Hood**, **Perle** and **Magnum** varieties. Fermented cool with a California Lager yeast, this sessionable ale should exhibit an enjoyable malt character, backed by a firm bitterness in the finish.

[North Brewing...](http://www.northbrewing.ca/)

_Belgian Pale Ale_ (5% ABV, 35 IBUs) - A hop-forward beer of the BPA style, think of it as an American Pale Ale with Belgian yeast character. Brewed with Belgian malt varieties, the beer was first-wort hopped with **Columbus**, and again during the boil at 30 minutes with the New Zealand **Wakatu** variety. Featuring further additions late in the boil and in the dry-hop with **Amarillo**, expect a fruity and citrusy beer! Fermented with the [Belgian Abbey II](http://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=130) yeast strain to allow the malt character to shine through.

Also note that North will be releasing this year's version of their popular _Glenora Strong Dark Belgian_. The second time their _Strong Dark Belgian_ has aged in their [Glenora](http://www.glenoradistillery.com/) whisky barrels (for 4 months), the long aging period allows the strong flavours to blend nicely. Available only in 650 mL bottles, the beer should continue to mellow as it is aged for months (or years!) to come.

[Authentic Seacoast...](http://www.rarebirdbeer.com/)

_Rare Bird Red Ale_ (5% ABV, 25 IBUs) - With a grist including roasted malts and Canadian Rye malt, this new amber-coloured beer features aromas of toffee and smoke, and similar flavours (including some spiciness from the Rye) that are balanced from the addition of American-style hops.

[Tatamagouche Brewing....](http://tatabrew.com/)

TataBrew are launching their Giant Series this week, so keep an eye out for these big brews on tap:

_Giantess Barleywine_ (11% ABV, 90 IBUs) – Named after [Anna Swan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Haining_Bates), Tatamagouche’s famous Giantess, an American Barleywine hopped with **Chinook**, **Centennial**, and **Columbus**.

_Two Rivers Baltic Porter_ (8% ABV, 36 IBUs) – Fermented with Lager yeast and cold-conditioned, and hopped with Czech **Saaz**, expect this one to be full-bodied, and “very smooth with hints of chocolate”, according to the brewery.

_Rum Barrel-Aged Dreadnot IBA_ (11.5% ABV, 52 IBUs) – Their standard _Dreadnot IBA_, but aged in fresh [Ironworks](http://www.ironworksdistillery.com/) rum barrels for an additional 4 months. Jumping from its original 7% ABV after the barrel aging, it’s currently exhibiting lots of rum presence, including vanilla. Hopped with **Waimea**, **El Dorado**, and **Cascade**.
