• This afternoon, [Picaroons](http://www.picaroons.ca/) will be having a mini-launch party for their "other" summer beer, Melonhead. Held at the Brewtique in downtown Fredericton, Melonhead will, of course, be available on tap. As well, several cats (only those 2.7 years or older) will be there taking part in the festivities, including the [winner of the Melonhead label contest](https://twitter.com/picaroons/status/340452893939359745/photo/1). [Real Food Connections](http://realfoodconnections.ca/) will be providing some "melon-esque" food, and some members of the [Chickadee Cat Club](http://www.chickadeecatclub.com/) will be attending to promote their cat show on the weekend. The fun starts at 2pm.

• [Garrison Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/garrisonbrewing) is releasing their Tilford's Nit Wit Belgian Witbier today, including tapping a firkin at the brewery at 4pm. It will be available at the NSLC, as well as the ANBL. The beer originally began as the winner of the 2010 Home Brew-Off Challenge, brewed by Scott Tilford, but has been so popular that it has been back every year since. Hopefully some of the other winners can make an appearance again too! And a reminder to homebrewers, the 2014 Brew-Off style has been announced: Weizen/Weissbier (BJCP style [15A](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style15.php#1a)).

• The owners of [Red Rover Brewing Co.](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) have recently begun their campaign to help raise money for their business. Geared to supporters that live in the Fredericton area, a $30 donation entitles you to a t-shirt customized to the area of Fredericton that you live in (i.e. North Side vs. South Side). Check out details and pictures of the shirt [here](http://www.redroverbrew.com/p/want-to-be-newest-red-roverlutionary.html). As well, "Red Roverlutionaries" will receive a membership cider mat made from local hardwood, be entered into random prize draws, and will be notified of upcoming exclusive events put on by the cidery.

• Brewmaster Nash at the[ Hart & Thistle](http://www.hartandthistle.com/) has released his latest concoction, the [High Voltage Double IPA](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2013/05/high-voltage-dipa-on-tap.html). This joins his [1913 Stock Ale](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2013/05/1913-stock-ale-on-tap-now.html), also on tap. It looks like a beautiful weekend to spend on a patio on the water in Halifax.

• Celebrating their recent [Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/winners/years/2013/) medal, [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301) will be tapping a keg of Tintramarre Saison at the Laundromat Expresso Bar this [Sunday at 4pm](https://www.facebook.com/events/295297653939109/). Come on down to taste this excellent beer!

• Thursday, June 6, there will be a [Beerthief tasting](http://www.beerthief.ca/beer-events/tasting-of-the-beer-from-propeller-brewery) of [Propeller](http://drinkpropeller.ca/) beers at the [Howley Estates NLC](http://www.nlliquor.com/stores/liquor-store?code=2) in St. John's. Propeller beers were part of a recent Beerthief order, and so Mike and Tom will be giving a guided tour of these beers. Congratulations to Mike for completing his [Certified Cicerone®](https://cicerone.org/) program, not an easy task!

• According to the [Coastguard](http://www.thecoastguard.ca/Business/2013-05-27/article-3261103/Microbrewery-welcomes-big-equipment/1) newspaper, the brewhouse for Shelburne's [Boxing Rock](http://boxingrock.ca/) brewery arrived last week. We look forward to their opening this summer, and will have some details on the setup soon!

• A head's up for good beer fans in NB:[ Unibroue's Grand Reserve 17](http://unibroue.com/en/beers/21/) is now available in [several ANBLs](http://www.nbliquor.com/location.html?upc=056910797172+&findit1.x=30&findit1.y=9) in Moncton and Fredericton. While not brewed in the Atlantic Provinces, it is a great Belgian Dark Strong (aka Quadrupel), and these styles are few and far between in the area. This beer will keep (and improve) for years if stored properly (cool and dark).

• While not in the Atlantic Provinces, Montreal is a short plane ride away for many of us. This weekend's [Mondial de la Biere](http://festivalmondialbiere.qc.ca/en/festivals/mondial_de_la_biere_montreal_2013/) event is certainly worth that plane ticket! It is held in a large convention hall, and has free admission. You then purchase tokens to spend on exactly the beers you want to try. And there are over [500 beers](http://festivalmondialbiere.qc.ca/pdf/mondialbiere_listebieres_2013.pdf) to try, so you won't get bored. It started Wednesday, and is on until Sunday.
