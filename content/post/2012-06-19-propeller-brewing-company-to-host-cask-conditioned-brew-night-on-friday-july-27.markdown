Propeller Brewing Company will host [their first Prop’r Cask Night on Friday July 27, from 6pm – 8 pm](http://www.facebook.com/events/320061534747889/). They’ll be pairing a surprise one-off brew alongside some fine local food courtesy of Harbour City Bar and Grill.

Tickets are sold on a first come/first serve basis are are limited to a total of 40. To reserve tickets, email Tracy at Promotions@drinkpropeller.ca and stop by the brewery to purchase prepaid tickets. Tickets cost $15.00 in advance, or $20.00 at the door.

Cask Night includes a sampling Propeller brands, a taste of the Cask and an appetizer selection from a great local restaurant.

One of the Propeller brewers will unveil and lead the ceremonious tapping of the cask at approximately 6:30pm and will be around to answer all questions about unfiltered, unpasteurized cask-conditioned beer.
