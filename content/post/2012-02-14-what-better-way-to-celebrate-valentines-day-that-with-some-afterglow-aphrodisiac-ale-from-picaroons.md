[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/afterglowaasmallweb.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/afterglowaasmallweb.jpg)Looking to come up with a special way to enjoy Valentine's Day 2012?  If you're in Fredericton head down to Picaroons Brewtique in order to enjoy some Afterglow Aphrodisiac Ale (why do I suddenly have a bass line stuck in my head?).  This is a bigger style beer (think Winter Warmer with less alcohol) that is brewed with Ginseng Root, [chili peppers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLvohMXgcBo) and chocolate and is sure to lead to a [whole lotta love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uPKcMkH0vw&feature=fvsr) (my claim not theirs).

Quantities are limited as they've only produced one batch so get it while you can.
