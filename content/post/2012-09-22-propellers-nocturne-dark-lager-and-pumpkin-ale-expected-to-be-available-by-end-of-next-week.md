As per their Twitter account ([@**propellerbeer**](https://twitter.com/propellerbeer)), Propeller Brewing Company will be launching Nocturne Dark Lager late next week.  $1.50 from each bottle sold will be donated to [Nocturne Halifax](http://nocturnehalifax.ca/), an art festival that will take place from 6pm to midnight in Halifax on Saturday, October 13th.  The beer is described as:


<blockquote>a Munich Style Dunkel. A clean lager profile, hoppy goodness balanced W/ a slight roasted finish.</blockquote>


In other Propeller news, Pumpkin Ale is expected to be available by next weekend.  Here is the description of the beer taken [from the company's website](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/beers/13-Pumpkin_Ale):


<blockquote>We brew this ale using Howard Dill's® world famous Atlantic Giant Pumpkins® with a special blend of spices - this of course in addition to the usual ingredients: highest quality malted grains, hops, water and yeast. It’s the next best thing to pumpkin pie.</blockquote>
