I normally keep the content on this blog to the local scene but when someone from Slovenia reaches out to me I'm ready to do a post.  Matej Pelicon, the Head Brewer for Pelicon Brewery, recently sent me the following email.  Whenever you're in Ajdovščina (sounds like Out-of-China), on the West side of Slovenia, be sure to check them out.

Hello fellow craft beer lovers,

I'm Matej from Slovenia, a homebrewer, beer lover and beer writer for Vino (wine) magazine. As winemaking is common in Slovenia, craft breweries seem not to follow this trend despite having one of the best hops in the world. You might heard about Styrian Golding, rumor has it monks at infamous Westvleteren use it in their beers.

I decided to start a craft brewery to spread the word about craft beer under family name Pelicon. My team of young talents from different professions and I launched a project on Kickstarter to crowdfund part of startup cost. Accidentally we became the first brewery in Europe who did this.

Here's [a link to more information including an entertaining video](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pelicon/the-pelicon-craft-beer).
