Trailway Adore and new ones from this week



 	
  1. Our brand new Double IPA - Adore - debuts tomorrow (30th). Citra, Amarillo, Ella, El Dorado üôè. Only 50 cases. Cans and draft at 11 am.


2) So pumped to release Seeing Ekuanot this week! This is another installment in our single hopped IPA "seeing" series. Ekuanot is a super interesting and flavourful hop with complexity that really makes this beer drink like it has multiple hop varieties in it. This one though was different from our any of our other hoppy brews in that about half of the dryhop was lupulin powder. Lupulin powder is concentrated lupulin separated from whole cone hops. The lupulin contains resins and aromatic and flavourful hop oils. The result is massive flavour and aroma without the vegetative and astringency that can be introduced when dryhopping at these rates with pellets or whole cone. Perhaps one of the most aromatic beers to come out of TW.
Cans available Wednesday at 5 pm. This was a 10 bbl batch and so therefore we will have only approximately 50 cases available. Find it at the tasting room in freddy only this week.

==================

Heritage Citra:

Citra Session IPA is on tap!!

This 5% Session IPA uses just enough Canadian malted barley and specialty malt to give this beer the backbone it needs to carry the Citra hop flavour. This beer comes in at 42 IBU with generous, but not overwhelming, additions of Citra hop in the boil and after fermentation. Typically this beer is described as having aromas and flavours of grapefruit, melon, gooseberry, passion fruit and lychee.

Future: Unfiltered Eph Bomb. Sour Motherfucker on Escarpment¬†_Brett Lambicus_ (Chris thinks), plus more cherries.

Unfiltered RSMA is back. All-Mosaic Double IPA.

Nfld notes:

Split Rock, double check that we've contacted them.¬†**Chris did in March, and we wrote it up. sending Qs this week**

Dildo: Roger and Angie are brother-sister, married to Debbie and Robert, respectively. Will be hiring a brewer.

==============================

- A slight correction to <a href="http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/06/16/friday-wrap-up-20170616/">June 16th</a>'s call for beer for the CCNB: we had the incorrect email address, so be sure to contact <a href="mailto:jared.christensen@ccnb.ca">Jared Christensen</a> for details on the¬†<strong>free</strong> beer testing. We now have the primer sent out to brewers looking for more information, <a href="http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NRC-CCNB-Beer-Testing.pdf">check it out here</a>.

=====================

**Just here to remind Chris:¬†**NOW here‚Äôs what the coffee itself looks like - from the Kayanza province of Burundi, the bean has natural notes of caramel, candy apple, lemongrass, and is faintly floral. The Calvados foeder at 2 Crows (which is sooooooo strong) blesses the beans with some additional toffee and black cherry undertones, and a noticeable (but not overpowering) boozy kick. It‚Äôs more prominent on the nose than on the flavour, but still very present. It‚Äôs definitely meant to be a specialty thing. Brew it as a single cup, and with care - chemex, v60, aeropress, espresso, cold brew, syphon. I‚Äôm always happy to offer advice on brew methods to anybody that might need assistance on making this coffee taste its‚Äô very best.

Another little thing to note is that we‚Äôve got some things planned for this coffee with Tidehouse Brewing - something that will be available soon-ish, and another even more special thing that you‚Äôll have to wait for (it will be worth it). Keep eyes peeled.
