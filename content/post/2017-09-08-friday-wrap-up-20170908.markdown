Well, it's official...September is here. Unofficially, summer is over, the days of Pumpkin Ales are upon us, and wet-hopped beers are approaching soon! If you're not a fan of one of these (or both), don't worry...while this week may be a bit slower in the new beer department compared to the last few, there's still some interesting brews newly released or coming soon that we'd love to get you caught up on...

• Charlottetown's [St. Paul's Church](https://sites.google.com/site/stpaulschurchsite/Home) will be celebrating their 250th Anniversary in 2019, and they've partnered up with [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) to have a special beer brewed as a means of fundraising for this important milestone. Head brewer Mike Hogan decided to brew a beer similar in style to one you'd see in England in the 18th century...hence, _Red Stone Stock Ale_ was born. The grist is made up of English Pale malt, Medium Crystal, and Chocolate malt. A 60 L grain-soured starter was whipped up, and added to half of the 30 BBL (3500 L) batch, resulting in a pH drop that gave some, but not too much, sourness. After boiling the wort and hopping it with English **Fuggles**, this half was then blended with the other, non-soured half (brewed with the same hop schedule), and the resulting wort was fermented. Afterwards, house-toasted PEI oak cubes were added, with the final product exhibiting an "oaky and sharp finish similar to the aged beers of the time". This brew will be released on September 17th, on tap at the brewery and a few select accounts, and in bottles, with all proceeds going to St. Paul's.

• There's a new beer flowing at the [Foghorn](http://www.drinkfoghorn.ca/) taproom in Rothesay, an Extra Special Bitter named after its proud brewer, Andrew Estabrooks. _Esty Special Bitter_ is a 5.5% ABV, 38 IBUs beer hopped with three new-to-Foghorn varieties: **Challenger**, **Target**, and **Olicana**. Fermented with, of course, an English yeast strain, expect a dry, slightly fruity brew that goes down easy. Available now for pints and growlers, it's also popping up at a few tap accounts in Saint John.

• More breweries in our region are working with [Escarpment Labs](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/) - a company in Guelph, Ontario, that produces liquid yeast cultures for breweries - to develop their own unique cultures for fermenting wort. [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) has joined this list, with the release of a new Saison, _Edel_, yesterday. The grist of this new beer is comprised of 70% Pilsner malt, and 20% raw wheat and 10% raw Rye from [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/), to 5.2% ABV. Hopped with organic French **Strisselspalt** to 21 IBUs, the wort was fermented with a special blend of yeast that Tatabrew worked on with Escarpment, that incorporates both a traditional Saison yeast, and a North American _Brettanomyces_ strain. The resulting beer was split into two batches; the first, being released today, was dry-hopped with more Strisselspalt, while the second has moved on into Tempranillo wine barrels and will be getting an addition of wine must this fall (look for this half to be released next spring). _Edel_ is a keg-only beer, so look for it at the brewery for growlers and pints, as well as on tap at both [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) locations, and [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/). Next spring's barrelled version, however, will also be released in bottles. We'll be sure to remind you when it's available!

• [Loyalist City Brewing](https://loyalistcitybrewing.ca) has released a variety of hoppy beers since they opened last fall, and this week they launched their third American IPA, _Point Blanc IPA_. This is a "New England IPA" brewed with a blend of Maris Otter in the grist, which provides a "light toasted malt presence" to balance the hop character provided from large whirlpool additions of **Citra**, **Centennial**, and **Mandarina Bavaria**, along with a heavy dry hop of **Centennial**, **Hallertau Blanc**, and **Mandarina Bavaria**. Fermented with the brewery's Vermont yeast strain, expect lots of citrus and grapefruit, and a high bitterness in the finish. Seek it out on tap at your favourite Loyalist City account!

• [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) is bringing back _version 2.0_ of their _Damn Fine Coffee and Cherry Pie Pale Ale_ today; to remind you, this is the one featuring the addition of Kenyan Nyeri Gatina coffee beans, roasted by [Java Blend Coffee Roasters](http://javablendcoffee.com/) and brewed by [Low Point Coffee Co](http://lowpointcoffee.ca/). The resultant cold brew was added to the beer, along with hop additions of **Falconer's Flight** and **Cascade**, giving you interesting flavours of coffee, chocolate, slight fruit, and some acidity. Look for it on tap at Good Robot, and, of course, other GR-friendly establishments in the HRM. Also, next Tuesday's **Beta Brewsday** (brewed by Robyn, Heather, and Kelly C.) will be _Low Hanging Fruit Milkshake IPA_ (6.6% ABV, 54 IBUs)- hopped with **Mosaic** Cryo hops, as well as pelletized **Amarillo**, **Citra** and **Columbus**. It was then rested on fresh Ontario peaches for a week; the fruity notes from both the hops and fruit help balance the slight sweetness from the addition of lactose powder. And finally, note that there will be no **Cask in the Sun** release today.

• Nackawic's [Big Axe](http://www.bigaxe.ca/) has finally confirmed that they will be expanding their 1 BBL brewery, which has been operating since April, 2014 out of co-owners' Peter and Tatiana Cole's Bed and Breakfast under the same name. The Big Axe Brewery and Saloon will be housed in a "wild west-style log home", built on the banks of the Saint John River in Nackawic. Scheduled to open in April, 2018, the 10 BBL (1150 L) brewhouse is being built by Charlottetown's [DME](http://www.dmebrewing.ca/). With 20 BBL fermentors also being constructed, expect plenty more Big Axe beer, including bottle and can distribution. The two-level saloon will have a wrap-around deck overlooking the Saint John River; food will be served as well. We'll be sure to update you as their progress continues. Congratulations to the Coles!

• After [backing out of their original plan to open a small batch brewery](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/01/06/friday-wrap-up-20170106/) in downtown Saint John early this year, [Moosehead](https://moosehead.ca/) has announced that they will indeed be adding a 20 BBL (2300 L) brewhouse and taproom to the company's original brewery at 89 Main St. West in Saint John. A 3 BBL (350 L) pilot brewery will also be constructed, with the idea behind both smaller brewhouses being experimentation, according to Moosehead. Current plans are for the new location to be up and running in May, 2018.

• And speaking of crafty (and pumpkin ales!), [A. Keith’s Historic Brewery](http://keiths.ca/) has a new batch out of their pilot system. Brewmaster Stefan Gagliardi, a self-proclaimed pumpkin head, perfected this recipe as a home brewer over many iterations and it’s one of his favorites. Ingredients include Vienna and Munich malts from [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/), pumpkin purée, and pumpkin pie spices including fresh ginger, Ceylon cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Look for malty, toasty and sweet pie crust elements to meet a full body and smooth mouthfeel highlighted by the spices. This is a small batch, with only three kegs going on the growler station at the brewery today.

• Those who have hops growing on their property are surely aware that the time is nigh for harvesting. Hop flowers, or cones, are starting to sound papery when squeezed, are going a little brown around the edges, and smell of the resinous lupulin that contains the essential oils and acids hops are known and loved for. We know that a couple of hop growing breweries in the region, including [Meander River](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) and [Big Spruce](http://bigspruce.ca/), have already had their picking parties and other producers will no doubt harvest soon if they haven’t already. Most of the hops harvested in our region will no doubt be processed normally: dried with warm, moving air, before being baled or pelletized and stored cold. But some hops are destined for nearly immediate use with a special technique known as “wet hopping”, “fresh hopping” or “green hopping” - adding freshly-picked, undried hops to a batch of beer during the brewing process. For best effect, wet hops have to be as fresh as possible, ideally within hours of picking, so that they do not spoil. Cold storage and shipping, if necessary, should not exceed 48 hours before the hops hit the beer. This gives breweries with their own on-site hop farms a leg up on making wet hopped beers. Using wet hops is much more risky than processed hops; with no laboratory analysis, alpha acid and essential oil levels are completely unknown. Because of this, to keep some control over the result, some breweries will use processed hops with known alpha levels for bittering and will save the fresh hops for flavour and aroma additions. When picked, hops are ideally still roughly 80% water and aren’t nearly as potent as dried, so significantly higher hop amounts must be used in wet hopping, often as much as 5 or 10 times the dried equivalent. Meanwhile, compounds that lose their potency during the drying process are still present and can make significant, and sometimes unwelcome, flavour contributions. Wet hopped beers, at their best, present a different side of hops, earthy and somewhat grassy, with a more subtle presentation of other flavour and aroma characteristics than usual. Look for wet hopped beers, often termed harvest ales to start appearing in the region over the next month or so!

• Speaking of which, if you've got hops growing on your property that you're not planning to use, and you can get them to Fredericton quickly after picking, [Graystone Brewing](http://graystonebrewing.com/) has put out a [call for hops](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYs-fJhghgU/) to be used in their Harvest Ale. Proceeds from the beer with go towards the [United Way of Central New Brunswick's](http://www.unitedwaycentral.com/) campaign.

_A bit of a quiet week for beer events and event announcements this week:_

• A reminder to those in Halifax that Stillwell is bringing one of the big (but little!) guns of American Farmhouse styles for a two-stage takeover this weekend as Maine's [Oxbow Brewing](http://oxbowbeer.com/) comes to town. Starting at **4 PM today** [some of the best Belgian-inspired beers you can imagine](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYoCg3jHAc6) will be pouring at [Stillwell HQ](http://www.barstillwell.com/) on Barrington Street. And tomorrow starting at noon [the party moves on up](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYqIDqXnDm8/) to The [Stillwell Beergarden](http://www.barstillwell.com/beergarden) on Spring Garden Road. The [full tap and bottle list](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYvsVn2Hnf1) is now available for this evening's festivities and chef Graeme Ruppel has put together a [burger-focused menu](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYyH2m4noV2) that'll melt your butter. If you've found yourself going into withdrawal after the Stillwell Belgian Takeover two weeks ago, if you're curious how American Farmhouse compares to the original, or if you just like really great beer, you owe it to yourself to get out today or tomorrow. No tickets required at either session.

• If you're in Charlottetown, PEI, or planning to be there in the next 24 hours, and you don't already have your tickets for the [PEI Beerfest](http://beerfestpei.com/) (part of the [Fall Flavours Festival](http://fallflavours.ca/)) at the Delta Prince Edward Hotel, what are you waiting for?! [Tickets are still available](http://beerfestpei.com/tickets/) for **tonight's 6:30 - 9:30 PM** session ($48 + taxes & fees) and **Saturday afternoon's 2:00 - 4:00 PM** shift ($36.50 + taxes & fees), but tomorrow evening's session is now sold out! The [brewery list](http://beerfestpei.com/breweries-beers/) is as up-to-date as it's going to get and the [live entertainment](http://beerfestpei.com/schedule/) is locked-in. A reminder also that Designated Driver tickets ($13.50 + taxes & fees) are available as well to help you arrange to get home safely.

• The [Maritime Honey Festival](https://www.facebook.com/maritimehoneyfestival/) will be taking place in Fredericton in a couple of weeks, and with beer's popularity continuing to rise, of course it has to take part! On **Saturday, September 23rd**, the ["Bee-R Garden"](https://www.facebook.com/events/340025273089532/) will be held between 10 am - 3 pm, at the Capital Exhibit Center. At least seven different local craft breweries will be taking part, each of which has been matched up with a beekeeper, and will be brewing a style of beer different from others attending, featuring, of course, honey. Ranging from a "Brett Honey Saison" from [Maybee](http://www.maybeebrew.com/) to an "Imperial Honey Porter" from [Foghorn](http://www.drinkfoghorn.ca/), attendees can expect a wide variety of brews! Be sure to check out the link for the list of styles from breweries who have committed to participate. And what honey-centric festival would be complete without mead? [Sunset Heights Meadery](http://www.sunsetheightsmeadery.com/) will be pouring seven different varieties of mead to satisfy your sweet tooth. Drink [tickets can be purchased now](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/bee-r-garden-tickets-37562273772?aff=Bee) - $8 for four 4 oz drink tickets, or $45 for unlimited samples - or at the door, where $11 gets you four drink tickets (no unlimited samples option).

_And a few last items before you get on with your weekend..._

- [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/)'s _Rise 'n Stein_ Hefeweizen (5.5% ABV, 13 IBUs) has returned, with this year's batch being available almost-exclusively in bottles at the brewery and HRM private stores; a limited amount may be available on tap, so keep your eyes open.
- PEI's [Moth Lane](https://www.facebook.com/MothLaneBrewing/) has released a new beer, _The Gorbine Double Black IPA_ (8.8% ABV, 85 IBUs), that is available now across the Island at Moth Lane tap accounts, and at the brewery.
- [Nine Locks Brewing](http://ninelocksbrewing.ca/) led the pack this year with the release of their _Harvest Pumpkin Ale_ earlier this week. It's available now in cans at the brewery and will appear at the NSLC in October.
- Bad news for fans of [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) _Dark and Stormy Night_: due to an ongoing legal dispute with "a big name in the spirits world", the beer has been discontinued and will not be brewed again. It doesn't appear that it will return under a different name, so if this is a brew you've enjoyed in the past, you may want to grab a bottle or two if you can find it.
- In Cask Friday news, the [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) _Organic Blonde on Yuzu_ we told you about last week is actually going on this evening at 5 PM. [Schoolhouse's](http://schoolhousebrewery.ca/) cask today is called _Oaked Grog Chequers_ obviously their Chequers Robust Porter aged on Oak, but what's the "grog" angle? Stop by the brewery this evening and find out!
