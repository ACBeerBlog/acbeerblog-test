[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hartandthistle_logo3.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hartandthistle_logo3.jpg)Check out this [entertaining video interview](http://www.truecanadianbeers.ca/updates/node/101) with Greg Nash from Hart & Thistle (when he's not working at [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.com/)) from the [True Canadian Beers](http://www.truecanadianbeers.ca/updates/) website to find out:



	
  * How under-aged Nash was when he started brewing.

	
  * What a "real" brewery is.

	
  * Where he had his first job out of brewing school (the city has celebrated [more NFL championships](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Which_team_has_won_the_most_NFL_championships) that any other team).

	
  * How likely he is to move back to Western Canada.

	
  * How the major breweries are helping the microbreweries.

	
  * How the demographics of microbrewery drinkers is changing.
