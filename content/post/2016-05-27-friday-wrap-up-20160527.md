Happy Friday everyone! We've got news on new brewery openings and plans, as well as a few new beers and events in our region.

• [TrailWay Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing)'s new brewery and taproom location officially opens to the public tomorrow, with the opening party beginning at noon! Located at 280 Main St. (on Fredericton's North Side), the brewery houses their new 10 bbl (~12 hL) [DME](http://www.dmebrewing.ca/) system, including four fermentors, as well as a taproom where the public can enjoy a pint, flight, and have their growlers filled. They will happily fill any clean 1.89 L growler (and will of course be selling their own), with smaller sizes likely being available in the near future. Four beers will be pouring, including their _Primetime_ Pale Ale, _Session IPA_, _D'Under_, and _Raspberry Wheat_. [Milda's Pizza and More](https://www.facebook.com/mildaspizzas/) will be there from [4:30-8:00 pm](https://www.facebook.com/events/1091775587532213/), serving up some specially-concocted pizzas to go with your beer. The taproom will remain open tomorrow until 10 pm; tentative hours for the coming weeks will be Wed and Thurs 11 am-9 pm, Fri and Sat 11 am-11 pm, and Sun 12 pm-5 pm; closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Look for their outdoor patio, which should provide seating for an additional 50-70 patrons, to open within a couple of weeks. Congrats to the TrailWay crew!

• A new brewery is in development in the town of [Montague, PEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montague,_Prince_Edward_Island). Local businessman Dave McGuire is aiming to open **Beer Island Brewery** in the downtown area in Spring 2017. The 15 bbl (18hL) brewhouse will feature a retail space and taproom, where patrons will be able to enjoy the beer while savouring locally-harvested food. Currently on the lookout for a brewer, the brewery plan includes a canning line, for packaging their beer for local and out-of-province distribution. “I’m a resident and I look forward to establishing a new business in town and supporting the development and growth of Montague,’’ says McGuire.

• From one new Island brewery to another, the Newfoundland Provincial government [announced a major investment](http://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/2016/btcrd/0524n08.aspx) in **Western Newfoundland Brewing Company**, to be opened later this summer in [Pasadena, NL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador). The brewery has been in development for more than two years, and plans on local distribution in the Corner Brook and Gros Morne region. Jennifer Galliott, Director of Marketing and Sales, says, "People can look forward later this summer to seeing _Killdevil_ Pale Ale and _Wild Cove_ Cream Ale on tap at Galliott Studios in Woody Point, The Cat Stop in Norris Point, and other select venues throughout the Gros Morne region. We hope this venture bolsters opportunity throughout Western Newfoundland to foster growth in our beloved region.” We will share more details of the brewery and availability once we have them. Congratulations to both new breweries coming to small towns on the Island provinces soon!

• [BarNone](http://barnone.beer/) released not one, but two new beers at their weekly growler night at the brewery last night. First up is _Outback Blonde_, a light, sessionable ale (at 4.7% ABV) that features a simple 2-row malt base, and is hopped with **Citra** and Australian **Galaxy**, for a delicious tropical hop character. Next is _Amber_, an American Amber Ale that is also easy-drinking (5% ABV), with a lower bitterness than their flagship _Pale Ale_. Hopped with **Centennial**, you can also expect some fruity aromas and flavours as a result. Look for both beers to pop up at various BarNone tap accounts in the near future, and drop by the brewery in Rose Valley next Thursday for Growler Night, which may feature some local musicians taking the stage.

• [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) is releasing their first Radler, a style that involves mixing flavoured soda with a strong beer. Originally created about a century ago in Germany, the resulting beverage is usually fruity, refreshing, and easy-drinking. Pump House's take, _Crafty Radler_, includes a mix of in-house-made grapefruit and tangerine soda, providing an aroma of "ripe, freshly-sliced grapefruit with sweet notes of ripened tangerines". Lightly hopped with **Willamette** to only 5 IBUs, it weighs in at 4.7% ABV. Look for it to be launched at this weekend's [Atlantic Beer Festival](http://atlanticbeerfestival.ca/) (more details below), and should follow at tap accounts and in cans by sometime next week.

• Drop by [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) today to celebrate Crop Top Tolerance ([#CroToTo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/crototo?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash))... After some complaints and negative comments were made about one of their servers who favours wearing a crop-top, Robie and the Robots have deemed today Crop Top Tolerance day. All patrons are invited to share their support by wearing their own Crop Top (or not), and celebrating the lovely weather we've been enjoying. And beginning this Monday, they are hosting weekly "Goodwill Bot" events, by inviting local non-profit organizations to set up shop and inform their patrons of their group. From 5-8pm May 30th, [Hope Cottage](http://www.hopecottage.ca/) will be dropping by to spread the word of their community meal services in Halifax. Plus, $1 of each pint sale will go to the Charity Case, which will be split among the participating nonprofit groups.

Here's the info you need on upcoming beer events...

That's it for this week! A few parting notes...

- One of [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/)'s first flagship beers, _Tante Blanche_, will be returning next week. This 4.7% ABV Belgian Witbier became a summer seasonal last year, so it's returning just in time! Look for it at the brewery for growler fills, on tap at better beer establishments across NB, and in bottles at ANBL stores next Wednesday.
- [Big Axe's](http://www.bigaxe.ca/) _Chanterelle Cream Ale_ is back on tap at the brewery, and their tap accounts, now that the harvest of these mushrooms is on again.
- Saint John community and college radio station [Local 107.3FM](http://localfm.ca/2016/05/26/name-a-new-beer-from-picaroons-traditional-ales/) is hosting a beer-naming competition. Local beer writer [Craig Pinhey](http://frogspad.ca/) has designed an English Session Ale, 4.5% ABV, that [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) will brew and release at their Saint John General Store on June 30th. Until June 15th, the public can submit their ideas for the beer name to [brian@cfmh.ca](mailto:brian@cfmh.ca) with the subject line: “Picaroons Traditional Ales – Radio Beer.” The winner will receive a growler of the beer.
- Best of luck to the Atlantic Canadian breweries who submitted and/or are in attendance at this weekend's [Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) in Vancouver! We'll be sure to share the details on the winning beers after Saturday's Award Presentation.
