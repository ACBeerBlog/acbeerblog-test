(Charlottetown, PE – September 5, 2012) Festivities for the 1st annual PEI International Beer Festival will start a day earlier as a result of a new partnership struck with Labatt Breweries. Labatt Blue has chosen to kick off the new beer festival with the national celebration - Ultimate End of Summer Party†.
Labatt Blue recently held a national vote to find Canada’s Most Iconic Town and Charlottetown came out the winner with the most votes in the country. To celebrate the win, Labatt Blue is hosting a free Ultimate End of Summer Party on September 27, 2012 beginning at 7 p.m. at the new Charlottetown event grounds on Grafton St. to kick off the 1stannual PEI International Beer Festival. Entertainment confirmed to date includes singer-songwriter Chris Dalziel and Island rockers Bad Habits with more surprise guests yet to be announced.

In addition to the Ultimate End of Summer Party, Labatt Blue will award one local charity The Good Stuff Award, a $25,000 grant to benefit their work in the community. Guests at the party will vote for their favourite charity from a list of three finalists as determined by Labatt Blue.

“It was a pleasant surprise to learn that the City of Charlottetown was chosen as Canada’s Most Iconic Town,” said Charlottetown Mayor Clifford Lee. “I encourage local charities to take advantage of this latest designation for the City by filling out an application to be entered in the draw. I hope the $25,000 prize money will go a long way to helping a local group with their community work.”

Charities who are interested in applying should contact [labattblue@edelman.com](mailto:labattblue@edelman.com) to receive an application form, additional details and deadline info. Charity finalists are encouraged to invite their supporters to the Ultimate End of Summer Party where the winner will be voted on live at the event. Come out and celebrate hometown pride with great entertainment, special guests and of course, cold Labatt Blue as the kick off to the 1st annual PEI International Beer Festival.

†No purchase necessary. Ultimate End of Summer party guests must be 19 years of age or older to attend.
