You wouldn’t know it by the weather in much of the region, but winter is theoretically on its way and we’re starting to see some seasonal brews in that vein released here on the East Coast. At the same time, there’s plenty of non-seasonal action in the ten-plus brand new beers announced, the craft scene continues grow with another brewery opening it’s doors in New Brunswick, and there’s lots of beer-related news to share and events in the offing. Here’s this week’s attempt to tell you everything you need to know about craft beer in Atlantic Canada.








• Congratulations are in order as [Foghorn Brewing](http://www.drinkfoghorn.ca/) in Rothesay officially opens their doors today. Located at [47 Clark Road](https://goo.gl/maps/8WPUUsYhQMq), immediately adjacent to the CrossFit gym, Foghorn is serving samples, pints, and growlers of five brand new beers, including _The Yellow Dart_ Session IPA (3.9% ABV), _Golden Grover_ British Golden Ale (5.0% ABV), _Brian_ Stout (5.0% ABV), _Constable Winchester_ IPA (6.5%), and _Old Forte_ Winter Warmer (6.5%). Their opening hours are 10-10 daily. For those who want to sit and enjoy a few pints, outside food is welcome, and can be ordered for delivery on-site (using the authentic restored 1950s era payphone). For those in NB, but not *quite* close enough to visit, look for kegs to hit local bars and restaurants late next week. For the latest news, be sure to follow their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/drinkfoghorn/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drinkfoghorn) pages. Check out our [Profile](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/10/06/foghorn-brewing/) of them, published in October.




• Following the maxim that when opportunity knocks one should open the door wide, [Boxing Rock ](http://boxingrock.ca/) recently found themselves saying yes to a batch of malt from local malthouse [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) that hadn’t proceeded as scheduled due to a power interruption. Assessing this malt as reminiscent of a more rustic, homegrown Pilsner, the next step was to source hops to compliment its biscuity, bready flavour. Enter [Clear Valley Hops](http://www.clearvalleyhops.com/) with both **Wild Turkey**, a native Ontario variety and **Crystal**, an American hop with noble German lineage through the **Hallertauer** family tree. The Wild Turkey brings a smooth bittering profile along with an herbal and floral aroma that matches well with the fruit from this Ontario-grown Crystal. The resultant beer, dubbed _Kilnus Interruptus_ was brewed in the American Pale Ale style at 5.5% ABV. It will be available on tap at select accounts in Halifax, in bottles at all of the private liquor stores in Halifax, in growlers at Boxing Rock’s stalls at the Halifax and Dartmouth farmers markets and, of course, at the brewery retail store in Shelburne. Only one batch of this irreproducible brew has been made, so you’ll want to act fast if you’d like a taste!






• Digby's [Roof Hound Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/roofhound/) is releasing a new beer this weekend, branching out the variety of their offerings. _Grumpy Cranberry Orange Sour_ is a 3.8% Kettle Sour beer, featuring loads of orange zest in the boil, and further aged on home-made cranberry sauce. To get you up to speed, Kettle Sours are a style of beer heavily inspired by the _Berliner Weisse_ of Northern Germany. Usually featuring wheat malt as a significant portion of the grist, the low ABV and light-bodied beer features a distinctive acidic character from lactic acid. _Lactobacillus_ bacteria are responsible for producing the acid, and are added to the wort in one of several ways: as a pure pitch from a yeast company; via un-mashed grain added to the wort (_Lacto_ is commonly found on raw barley grain); or through _Lacto_-containing cultures, including yogurt. After addition of the bacteria, the wort is kept warm while the pH lowers, usually to 3.5 or lower (standard beer is in the pH 5 range). Once complete, the beer is heated/boiled to kill the _Lacto_, and then cooled and further fermented with a more traditional ale or lager yeast. For more beer learnin', check out [Milk the Funk](http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Wort_Souring#Souring_in_the_Boil_Kettle), a resource for commercial and homebrewers alike. Drop by Roof Hound on Saturday, **November 19th** for the release, with the beer flowing at 9pm, and [Tide & Timbre](https://www.facebook.com/tideandtimbre) playing a set starting at 10pm.

• PEI's [BarNone](http://barnone.beer/) has a couple of new beers in the pipeline: first up is _SMaSH Ella_, a single-malt-and-single-hop beer featuring - you guessed it - **Ella**, an Australian hop varietal. This relatively-new hop is known for "distinct tropical flavours", especially when used in the dry-hop, which it definitely was with this brew. Very pale-coloured, it's easy-drinking at just 4.2% ABV and 23 IBUs; look for it on tap around the Island this weekend. Next is BarNone's first take on the Extra Special Bitter style, which has been a frequent request by fans of the brewery. _Bitter Winter_ ESB features a grist made up mainly of floor-malted barley from Nova Scotia's Horton Ridge, and was hopped with U.K. varieties. Fermented, interestingly enough, with an Abbey-style yeast strain, the beer weighs in at 5.6% ABV and 36 IBUs. This one was just brewed recently, so look for it on tap in a couple of weeks.

• The winter beers continue to trickle in, as [Flying Boats](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710) is releasing their newest seasonal, _Fireside Friend_, which is their take on the Winter Warmer style. A full-bodied ale exhibiting plenty of malt character, expect flavours of caramel, nuts, and molasses. Further-complemented with the additional of spices such as cinnamon sticks, grated nutmeg, cloves, and peeled ginger, this is naturally a bigger beer, weighing in at 7.1% ABV and 32 IBUs. This one is going to be available on tap only; expect to see it any day now at the following locations: the [Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/), [James Joyce Irish Pub](https://www.facebook.com/The-James-Joyce-Pub-187205728006725/?fref=ts), [Graystone](http://graystonebrewing.com/), [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/), and [Ducky's Pub](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar).

• Taking a left-turn from the winter beers, Nyanza's [Big Spruce Brewing ](http://www.bigspruce.ca/)has released _Langered Stook_, a "Hoppy Half Wit". Brewed in the Hopfenweisse style (which originated between a collaboration between [Schneider and Brooklyn Brewery](http://www.schneider-weisse.de/weissbier/meine-hopfenweisse)), it features Belgian Witbier and German Hefeweizen characteristics, with a healthy dose of hops. In this case, lots of late and dry-hop additions of **Amarillo**, **Citra**, **El Dorado**, and **Mandarina Bavaria**, which themselves display notes of fruit and citrus, are enhanced by fermentation using the Fruity Witbier yeast from [Escarpment Labs](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/). At 4.8% ABV and 43 IBUs, this isn't your Uncle Dieter's Hefe! Look for it on tap in HRM at [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/), [Lion & Bright](http://lionandbright.com/) and [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/), as well as at the Big Spruce and [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) co-Tap Takeover at [Governor's Pub](http://governorseatery.com/) after Saturday's [Cape Breton Beer Fest](https://www.capebretonbeerfest.com/).

• [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) has announced the details on their latest one-off release at their General Store in Saint John - _Cranberry Wheat_ is just as the name suggests, an American Wheat Ale brewed with real cranberries, sourced from Sunberry Cranberry Producers out of Maugerville, NB. Described by the brewery as "sweet, smooth, and just a tiny bit of tart", it's quite sessionable at 4.2% ABV. Available on tap now, for a limited time.





• Tuesday of this week saw a new beer available on tap at [Yellowbelly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St. John’s. On the face of it, _Labrador Lager_ is vaguely reminiscent of last year’s _Oktoberfest_, the brewery’s first lager, which was a festbier made with Pilsen, Munich and Vienna malts and **Styrian Goldings** and **Saphir** hops. The Labrador replaces the Vienna with Caramunich, which will bring additional body and some sweetness, and substitutes **Super Styrian** hops for the Styrian Goldings while featuring “a ton” of the Saphir to bring a sweet citrus character. Billed as 6.5% ABV and in the Helles Bock style, it’s been lagering for weeks now and should be well-balanced and integrated.




• Hot on the heels of last week’s _Danko_ SMaSH comes another new offering from [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/), this time a devious-sounding DIPA with specs that may very well give prospective hop-lovers a slight pause. Listed at a massive 10% ABV and a typically NASH-ian 100+ IBU, this beer has been aged on white oak for 8 weeks or so and apparently displays none of the warning signs you’d normally detect from such a powerful brew, so they put it in the name. _Warning Label_ is available starting today at the brewery and next door at Charm School for pints and growler fills. Whatever happens, you will not be able to say that you were not warned.








• Those crazy kids at [Good Robot Brewing Company](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) are releasing a new beer today: _Extra BIG-ASS Beer - Camacho Lager_ is an amber malty lager in the European style, somewhere in the vicinity of a Märzen or Oktoberfest. The malt bill features Vienna, 2-row, coffee and smoked malts, with some flaked oats to enhance the mouthfeel. On the hops side it marries two varieties developed and released in the 1970s, the German **Perle**, known for a floral and spicy character, and the American **Willamette**, which features fruity and floral notes. A true lager, it is bready on the nose and the palate, with prominent roasted flavours, some lingering spice, and a crisp, dry finish. At 5.2% ABV and 24 IBU, it’s gluten-reduced and should be quite crushable. You’ll be able to find its ample hindquarters today at the Good Robot taproom.




• Halifax's [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is releasing the latest in their **Cellar Series** today, a Rum Barrel-Aged version of their _Honey Lavender_. The base beer, produced with lavender grown at Meander River, and wildflower honey, spent several months in [Ironworks Distillery](https://ironworksdistillery.com/) barrels, taking on loads of rum and wood character, as well as a few points of alcohol, with this version weighing in at 11.0% ABV (the non-barrelled is 6.5% ABV). Grab a bottle or two (this beer is perfect for aging) at the brewery today, as it is in high demand and short supply!




• Today is the release of Episode 1 of the [902 BrewCast](http://www.902brewcast.com/) podcast. Kyle, Phil and Tony sit down with Peter Burbridge and Josh Herbin of [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) to learn more about how they got to where they are, and what's next for the brewery. Sharing some beers and chatting beer, sounds like a great way to spend your hour commute home today. Subscribe to the podcast [here](http://simplecast.com/podcasts/2452/rss), iTunes and Google Play links are coming shortly. *Maybe wait until you're home to crack open that _Wiley Boys II_.*


As we pass the half-way point of the month, there are plenty of great events coming up on our radar. Here are a select few that we can cram in today:

• New Brunswick-based band (and hop farmers) [Earthbound Trio](http://www.earthboundtrio.com/) are embarking on a Maritimes Brewery tour **today**. Starting at [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) Nov 18, they will be at the Big Spruce/Breton Brewing after-party November 19th, and Roof Hound Brewing **Nov 22nd**.

Pours of their _Table Beer_, _Wild NE IPA_, and _100% Brett Fermented Golden Ale_, all produced on their pilot system, will be available to thirsty attendees. [Sober Island Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/soberislandbrewing/?fref=ts) will be debuting their _British IPA_ at the Fest, as well as a cask of their _Mild Ale_, plus a bevvy of brand new beers mentioned here (and not)...

• [Uncle Leo](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/)'s will be launching a brand new beer **November 23rd**, _Sunburst Pale Ale_.

Drop by Piper's for a glass of the beer (from a special cask double dry-hopped with **Amarillo** and **Simcoe**) and appetizers. Tickets are $20, and available at Uncle Leo's (by phone or in person), and are limited to only 60, so act today! Find out more on their [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/events/932621536870429/).

• [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) will be hosting a tap takeover at Charlottetown's [Hopyard](https://www.facebook.com/hopyardbeerbar/?fref=ts), next **Friday, November 25th**. [HopUp](https://www.facebook.com/events/1732343547085435/) will begin at 6 pm and continue until close, with all ten taps belonging to tasty Upstreet brews... including a special release brewed specifically for the tap takeover. Upstreet is calling this one a SMaTH SIPL; no, we don't have a lisp... that's a "Single Malt and Triple-Hopped Session India Pale Lager". Brewed with Maritime 2-row malt and hopped with New Brunswick-grown Columbus, Chinook and Nugget, it comes in at 4.5% and 45 IBUs, and is described as "clean, crisp, dank and piney"; the name will be released when the beer is!
