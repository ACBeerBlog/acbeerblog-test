The little town of [Montague, PEI](https://www.townofmontaguepei.com/) (located on the eastern end of the Island) is going to be getting a lot bigger this coming summer... at least, beer-wise! Husband and wife team Ken Spears and Ashley Condon announced early this month that they plan on opening [Copper Bottom Brewing](https://copperbottombrewing.com/) sometime by mid-summer. This is one of two breweries scheduled to open in Montague in 2017 (the other being Montague Brewing), with Ken and Ashley planning to focus on live music, as well as beer, in the brewery's accompanying tap room. We've recently exchanged emails with Ken to find out what the couple have in store for when the brewery launches this summer...

**Can you tell us a little bit about yourselves?
**I am a Red Seal electrician turned brewer originally from Nova Scotia. My wife, Ashley Condon, is an award-winning songwriter and touring musician originally from Murray Harbour North, PEI. We live in the woods in rural PEI just outside of Montague and have a cat named Fiona. We enjoy hiking, the beach, and Ashley does yoga in the upper part of the “Brewdio” (the barn on our property that houses the "nanobrewery" and yoga/music studio)

**How did you get into the world of craft beer?
**I fell in love with craft beer in 2003 when I landed a job at [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) in Halifax. The owner, John Allen, became a mentor to me, offering advice and inspiring me to follow my passion. Ashley fell in love with craft beer by proxy and by travelling around North America as a musician visiting local microbreweries. When we travel together we spend lots of time visiting local breweries as well, and have grown to love the whole craft beer scene together which is pretty cool.

**What made you decide to take the step into opening a brewery?
**Ashley and I moved to PEI in 2011. The move inspired change and I quickly realized PEI was the perfect place to open a microbrewery. I also realized that PEI needed more options for craft beer. Having been exposed to the thriving craft beer scene in Nova Scotia, I was excited to see how PEI’s craft beer scene could grow as well. I also felt like my love of brewing could be an asset to the community and allow me to follow my passion.

**Care to share some info on your homebrewing history?
**I love experimenting with new beer styles and playing with the flavours. The brewhouse is currently a converted 50 litre keg, propane-fired nano brewery. As mentioned previously, we call our barn the “Brewdio” because it’s a brewery and music/yoga studio in one.

**Do you have an approximate launch date?
**We are aiming so serve our first pint mid-summer 2017.

**What size/manufacturer/type of system will you be brewing on? Expected output (monthly, yearly, etc)?
**We have a [DME](http://www.dmebrewing.ca/) 10 BBL (~1170 L) system that has 7000 L cellar capacity to start with, and room to grow.

**What are your plans for distribution? Plans for tap accounts, bottles, growlers, etc.? Are you licensed for on-site sales?**
We will have several tap accounts across the Island with growler fills from the brewery, and eventually cans distributed to PEILCC stores. Our tap room - which overlooks the Montague river - will be set up for pints served daily.

**Do you have some initial accounts in the area lined up to serve your beers?
**Stay tuned!

**Can you tell us about the beer(s) you plan on offering initially? Are you planning on offering a specific style, or genres (Belgian, English, etc), of beer? Any seasonals, one-offs, or will you stick mainly with a "flagship lineup"?
**We are committed to a wide variety of styles to keep our options open for experimenting. We will have flagships and we have planned for exciting one-off brews and smaller batches. Keep up-to-date on our Brews News blog on our [website](http://www.copperbottombrewing.com). We will be documenting the entire building process as well.

**Have you had any assistance from other breweries/people in Atlantic Canada (or elsewhere)?
**We have been in touch with several brewers across the country and everyone has been really helpful. In particular, John Allen (Propeller Brewing in Halifax), Jeremy White ([Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) in Cape Breton), Don Campbell ([Barnone](http://barnone.beer/) in PEI), Simon Livingston ([L’Espace Public](http://www.lespacepublic.ca/) in Montreal) and Mitch Cobb and Mike Hogan ([Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) in PEI).

**Where do you hope to see your brewery in the next 2-3 years?
**We will be distributing across PEI and collaborating with other breweries. We also hope to be a hub in our community, hosting monthly events and growing our networks within the artistic and brewing communities.

**Do you have a favourite beer style, beer, or brewery you enjoy drinking?
**I love dark, malty beers as well as light and hoppy… and sour beers are changing my life!

**How about a favourite style or ingredient to brew with?
**I love brewing with the American "C" hops and Maris Otter malt.

_It's fantastic to see yet another craft brewery planned to open in PEI, and we're looking forward to hearing more from Ken and Ashley over the coming months, with updates on their progress! Be sure to follow along on their website, as well as their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/copperbottombrew/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/copperbrews) accounts, and of course we'll be sure to include any news in our weekly Friday Wrap-Up._
