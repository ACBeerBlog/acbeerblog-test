Happy end of the week! How about some local beer news to transition from stifling hot temperatures into hurricane weather?

• [Garrison Brewing Co](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is releasing a special beer today, _Summer Fest Blonde_. Brewed as a celebration of the 15 year support of the [Halifax Jazz Festiva](http://halifaxjazzfestival.ca/)l, this light ale was brewed with Maritime Malt and 10% wheat malt, and hopped with **Columbus**. Weighing in at 4% ABV and 8 IBUs, this will be a nice refreshing drink to enjoy at the Fest. It is being launched today on tap at the JazzFest (which runs July 4-12), and will be available soon on tap at the brewery for samples and growler fills. For a peek into Garrison's brewery expansion, and the _Summer Fest_ brewday, check out [this post](http://halifaxjazzfestival.ca/blog/celebrating-15-years-garrison) by Jazz Marketing assistant Tenille Goodspeed.

• [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) has brewed up another new beer - _Vic Park Pale Ale_ is described by the brewery as an "amped up Pale Ale that isn't quite an IPA". Brewed with a grist of 100% Vienna malt (which provides a flavor of lightly-toasted bread crust), the beer is hopped with **Citra** and **Kohatu**, which provide aromas and flavors of grapefruit and tropical lime, as well as a "spicy noble character". Finishing dry, the beer comes in at 5.2% ABV, with ~40 IBUs. Only a small batch was brewed, so it's only available on tap at the [Gahan House](http://www.gahan.ca/), and for pours/growler fills at the brewery.

• [Propeller Brewing Co](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) is continuing their very popular One Hit Wonder series, with this week's release of their _Session IPA_. Brewed with 2-Row Pale Ale, Crystal, Wheat and Pilsner malts to 4.5% ABV, this beer is punching above its weight in the hop department, with lots of **Cascade** and **Columbus** , to 45 IBU bitterness, and lots of aroma from late hopping. As with all of the One Hit Wonder beers, the best place to guarantee satisfaction is to grab a growler at the Halifax and Dartmouth brewery locations. And if you drop by the Dartmouth brewery today, you can grab lunch from the [Cheese Gypsy](http://www.cheesegypsy.ca/) food truck onsite from 11:30-3pm.

• [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/) is launching a couple of new beers as part of their Tap Takeover at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) tomorrow (a few tickets to the noon and 8pm sessions are still available, contact Stillwell to grab some). While some of the new beers were brewed in small batches only for this special event, there are a couple that will be available at the brewery beginning next week. Their _East Coast Beer_ (_Sea Salt and Caramel_), weighs in at 6% ABV, and features products from three important East Coast industries: Farming, as the beer was brewed using Maritime Malt; Fishing, as dulse was added to the beer for a light salt character; Forestry, as the beer was aged on locally-grown cedar. The _HopScotch Barrel-aged Double IPA_ will also be available next week at the brewery. This 10% ABV and 100+ IBU beer has been aging in a freshly-emptied Glenora barrel since February. Fear not, hop heads, as upon transfer into the barrel, the beer was hammered with **Simcoe**, **Citra**, and **Galaxy** varieties, and the aroma has definitely persisted throughout its hibernation. Both of these beers are available in Squealers at the brewery.

• There's another new brewery looking to start up in New Brunswick - [A.W.O.L. Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/awolbrew) will be located in Riverview, and is founded by homebrewer (and Sergeant in the Canadian Army) Robert Black. Currently, Robert plans on having three beers - including a Belgian Pale Ale, an Amber brewed with rye-soaked oak chips, and a hoppy American Brown - and one mead in his regular line-up. A.W.O.L. currently has a fundraising campaign set up [here](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-w-o-l-brewery), to help raise the money necessary to build their 2-bbl brewery, and to be operation by this fall. There's several incentives available, based on donation amount, ranging from pint glasses to the chance to be an assistant brewer for a day. Now's your chance to help a local brewery get started! We'll have more news on A.W.O.L. as their progress continues. You can also follow along with them on Twitter and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/awolbrew).

• The [Picaroons Brewer's Bash](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) is only a week away, and their beer truck is currently making its way east to Fredericton! Its trip began earlier this week when it started picking up beer from participating breweries in British Columbia, was in Saskatchewan yesterday, and heading through Manitoba today. You can keep an eye on their [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/BrewersBash) for updates. And stay tuned next week, as we hope to have a list of the beers being poured at the festival by the Atlantic Canadian breweries attending, similar to what we did [last year](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/07/11/brewers-bash-atlantic-canadian-beer-list/).

• Looking to get a job at a newly-opened craft brewery? Well, [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) (which just opened a couple of weeks ago) is looking to fill a part-time position, with the possibility of stepping up to full-time. The job involves lots of beer-lifting, and experience in customer service is required. Drop by the brewery if you're interested, or send them off an [email](mailto:cjost<at>tatabrew.com).

• A reminder that tickets are still available for the [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) Beer Pairing Reception at [harbourstone sea grill & pour house](http://www.marriott.com/hotel-restaurants/yhzmc-halifax-marriott-harbourfront-hotel/harbourstone/5470933/home-page.mi) July 10th. The full menu is available on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NorthBrewingCompany/photos/a.304786532934290.73363.266752013404409/681730058573267/?type=1&theater), and will mark the launch of their new _California Common_ beer. Tickets are only [available online](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/harbourstone-and-north-brewing-beer-pairing-reception-tickets-11898116587), so pick them up now!

On a personal note, Chris would like to thank Alan and Brenda at [Meander River](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/), the [Sea Level](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) and [Port Pub](http://www.theportpub.com/) crew, and Jeff at [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/) for a wonderful Canada Day in the Annapolis Valley. Showing six beer-thirsty American visitors around our region was the perfect way to spend July 1st!
