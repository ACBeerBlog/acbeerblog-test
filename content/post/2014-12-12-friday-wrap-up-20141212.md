Good morning! After a couple of very busy beer-news weeks, it looks like things have slowed down a bit... but there's still quite a bit going on in the Atlantic Canada beer world!

• We have some more info on the new Sweet Stout (aka Milk Stout), _La Vaca Loca_, brewed by [BarNone](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing). This complex, dark beer was months in the making; co-owner/brewer Don Campbell had long wanted to brew a Sweet Stout with cacoa nibs from [Island Chocolates](http://www.victoriabythesea.ca/IslandChoco.html) in Victoria-by-the-Sea. Brewed with seven different malts, the beer has lactose powder added late in the boil to increase body and sweetness. During secondary, there are additions of the cacoa nibs (which have been soaked in alcohol), vanilla bean (also soaked in alcohol), and Belgian candy. On top of all this, Campbell saved some of the cacoa nibs for a final addition, or "dry-nibbing". This 6.4% ABV Stout should be available soon! And their Imperial IPA, _The Little DIPA_, should now be on tap at [The Pilot House](http://thepilothouse.ca/) and [Baba's Lounge](http://www.cedarseatery.com/Babamain.html) in Charlottetown... go get some!

• [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery), meanwhile, has also provided more details on their newest beer, _Wrath of Putin Imperial Pale Ale_. A stronger beer at 7.5% ABV, it is hopped to 75 IBUs with two varieties - **Centennial** and **Goldings** - from [Southan Farms](http://www.southanfarms.net/). It is described by the brewery as having a "golden amber color" and "strong hop flavor with a clean malty sweetness"; look for it on tap in Fredericton at [540 Kitchen & Bar](https://www.facebook.com/540kitchenandbar) and [Vault 29](https://www.facebook.com/vault29nb). Also note that Big Axe is currently closed for growler fills and retail sales until December 28th.

• [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery)'s Chocolate Coconut Porter, [_Into the Dark_](http://acbeerblog.ca/2014/11/21/friday-wrap-up-20141121/), is finally ready! Along with the toasted cacao nibs and toasted coconut, owner/brewer Shane Steeves decided to go ahead and add some steeped coffee from local roaster [Java Moose](http://www.javamoose.com/) as well. Sounds like a good idea to us! Look for this 6.3% ABV Porter on tap at the usual Hammond River accounts in New Brunswick over the next few days.

• [Sea Level Brewing](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) is bringing back one of their seasonals, _High Street Wee Heavy Scotch Ale_. Brewed to style, it's a malty beer with a "sweet caramel taste", accompanied by toasted and roasted flavors. A dark-amber, 6.4% ABV ale, you can find it now at the brewery in cans, and for growler fills. Look for it on tap in Halifax and the Annapolis Valley at select beer bars/restaurants, and in cans at the private liquor stores in Halifax.


• [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) has released their Festive Ale this week, _Maple Squash Ale_. Organic, locally grown and roasted [Red Kuri Squash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kuri_squash) from [Waldegrave Farms](http://farm.waldegrave.org/) in Tatamagouche, along with organic Maple Syrup from [Acadian Maple](http://www.acadianmaple.com/), were used to create this special beer. Malagash-grown **Goldings** and **Willamette** hops were used to balance  for a nice smooth finish, with a hint of spicing and sweetness on this 5.1% beer. It is on tap for growler sales at the brewery now, and will hit the local bars and be in bottles next week. For those not lucky enough to have picked up a ticket to the Festive Brunch with the [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/) at [Bar Stillwell](%20http://www.barstillwell.com/) Sunday at noon, we expect there to be some still on tap at 4pm, when the bar is open to all. Look for merch and goodies from both TataBrew and the LBL that afternoon. And the LBL crew will be on hand to answer questions and chat about their membership and discount card, which will be released in January 2015. We have a preview of the discounts available [here](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/?page_id=613), looks like a great value for $25!







• Coming soon from TataBrew is their _Oyster Cloister_, an Oyster Stout. Yes, you read that correctly, an [Oyster Stout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stout#Oyster_stout)! Brewed with the dark and roasty malts characteristic of a stout, Malagash-grown oysters were added to the boil for a special kick, and a faint saltiness to complement the roast character. Weighing in at 5.3%, it also features Tata farm-grown **Willamette** and **Goldings** hops. This brew will be released in growlers and 650 mL bottles, and your friendly neighbourhood pub, on December 31st.







• In preparation for their participation in the [Craft Beer and Local Food](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/482/craft-beer-and-local-food-celebration-2015) event January 15th, the TataBrew Crew invited the [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) Crew over for a brewday last week. Tyler, Evan and Josh assisted with the milling, mashing in and out, and measuring and adding of hops. Look for this special collaboration beer to debut on the 15th, and we'll have more details closer to that date.


• [Yellowbelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St. John's has released their annual _Mummer's Brew_ seasonal beer. This year's style is a Chocolate Coffee Porter, and weighs in at 6%. Maris Otter base malt with a healthy dose of Baird's Black and Thomas Fawcett Roast Barley malts complete the bill. Light additions of **East Kent Goldings** and **Willamette** hops were used to balance the beer, to 30 IBUs. After primary fermentation (using a blend of American and British Ale and Champagne yeasts), [Newfoundland Chocolate Company](http://newfoundlandchocolatecompany.com/) cocoa nibs were added to the tank, and [Fixed](http://fixedcoffee.com/) cold-steeped coffee was blended in during transfer to the packaging tank. The resultant dark ruby-coloured beer features roast and chocolate notes, with some noble hop character, and a slight warming characteristic. The beer is on tap now, and bottles should be available next week.

• Coming soon from Yellowbelly is a _Christmas Cider_. This special release features fresh-pressed cranberry juice from the West Coast of Newfoundland, and is  drier than their _Yellow Mellow_ Cider. The cranberries lend a pink hue to the body, and a fruit aroma that melds nicely with the apple character. This cider weighs in at 6.5%, and will only be available in bottles at Yellowbelly and the local NLC locations. Look for it in the next week or so.

• [Distillerie Fils du Roi](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/) est situé à Petit-Paquetville, sur la Péninsule acadienne de nouveau brunswick. Ils produisent des esprits il y a deux ans, et ont récemment acquis l'équipement supplémentaire pour brasser de la bière. Leur première bière est _Caraquet Flyer_, nommé d'après un train qui a été utilisé dans la région dans les années 1880. La bière est du style [Eisbock](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style05.php#1d), en utilisant un procédure de congélation et l'enlèvement de l'eau de la bière pour permettre le niveau d'alcool se élever à 8,5%. La bière a a été approuvé par Revenu Canada, Agence canadienne d'inspection des aliments et de la sécurité publique, mais est maintenant en attente d'approbation de la ANBL, qui malheureusement ne peut être accordée qu'après une réunion du conseil en Février 2015. Nous avons hâte d'essayer cette nouvelle bière, et futur bières saisonniers de la Péninsule acadienne.




 • [Distillery Fils du Roi](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/) is located in Petit-Paquetville, on the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick. They have been producing small batch spirits for two years, and have recently acquired the additional equipment to brew beer. Their first beer is _Caraquet Flyer_, named after a train that was used in the region in the 1880s. The beer is an [Eisbock](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style05.php#1d), using a method of freezing and removal of water from the beer to allow the alcohol levels to rise to 8.5%. The beer  has been approved by Revenue Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Public Safety, but is now awaiting approval from the ANBL, which sadly may not be granted until after a board meeting in February 2015. We look forward to trying this new beer, and future seasonal brews from the Acadian Peninsula.

•  [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) in Florenceville-Bristol is now offering CSB shares. Community Supported Brewing shares are available from the $125 to $500 level, offering at least 20% bonus return in beer and merchandise, plus invitations to special events, dinners and free brewery tours. Contact [Mitch at the brewery](mailto:mitch<at>railcarbrewing.com) for more details, and help support your local brewery!




• Unfortunately, the third [Burgers n' Beer](https://www.facebook.com/events/1508400606096726/) event in Fredericton, which was scheduled for earlier this week on December 9th, had to be cancelled again due to poor weather conditions. However, it has been rescheduled for Tuesday, January 6th (still at the uptown [reLiSH](http://relishyou.ca/) location from 8:00 - 10:30 pm), and there's still a few tickets available! Here's hoping for better weather this time around!

• A reminder that today is the first day of the [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) [12 Beers of Christmas](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons/photos/a.358849697004.151616.233394352004/10152550911607005); the first beer will be released for growler fills (two per person maximum) at the Brewtique, and the style/beer will be announced online at noon. For those of you outside of Fredericton who are disappointed you won't be able to take part, good news... [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) will be featuring a tap takeover on December 23rd, where all 12 Christmas-themed beers will be on tap at the same time! No charge, just show up to sample one, two, or all twelve beers while you're out doing your last-minute shopping/trying to get away from the in-laws already.

Here's hoping your weekend is filled with good beer! [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/) has their _Honey House Ale_ back on tap for growler fills at the brewery, and [Garrison'](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/)s _Spruce Beer_ is definitely being released at the brewery this morning (the bottling issues were resolved), and on its way to the private stores and other provinces as well. And congratulations to Jake Saunders, who is now the Brewmaster at [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/). Be sure to drop by and wish him a warm welcome, and look out for his first brew on the RB system to be released soon.
