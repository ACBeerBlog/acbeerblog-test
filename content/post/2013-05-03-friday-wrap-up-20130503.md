- Tomorrow, May 4th, [Picaroons](http://www.picaroons.ca/) will be hosting a tap-takeover at [Plan B Bar & Lounge](http://planbmoncton.com/) in Moncton. For this "May the 4th Be With You" event, the six taps will include Dark & Stormy Night, Dooryard, Best Bitter, Timber Hog, Yippee IPA, and Feelsgood Imperial Pilsner; the band [Gravity Strike](https://www.facebook.com/gravitystrikemusic) will also be providing live music. Tickets are $10, and the event starts at 10:00 p.m.

Also on Saturday, Picaroons is releasing a special beer named JED IPA. This beer is their Yippee IPA "_insanely_ dry-hopped with Galaxy, Comet, Aurora, Delta, Apollo, and Phoenix hops", according to Dennis Goodwin, Marketing Director at Picaroons. JED IPA will be available exclusively at the Picaroons Brewtique in growlers only, and also on tap at Plan B Saturday night.

- The [Pump House Brewery](http://www.pumphousebrewery.ca/) has released two more of their seasonal beers in bottles, just in time for the warm weather! The Maple Ale, at 5% ABV, is described as an amber-colored beer with an aroma that is slightly sweet, yet with a hint of Columbus hops in the background. The taste shows off the maple character, as the beer is "allowed to age upon an ample quantity of pure maple syrup, sourced from locally tapped sugar maple trees". The second beer is their Braunschweig Wicked Wheat (Braunschweig is the German word for "Brunswick"). Also at 5% ABV, this beer sounds like it's along the lines of a Hefeweizen, with a golden color, and aromas and flavors of banana and clove. Look for these beers at various [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) stores across New Brunswick.

- [Big Spruce Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) in Nyanza Cape Breton is having a busy time these days, brewing often to keep up with demand in Cape Breton, Halifax, and locations in between. They are looking for a summer student to run their sales counter four days a week, to help move their growlers and merchandise. If you are over 19 and interested, email [bigsprucebrewing@gmail.com](mailto:bigsprucebrewing@gmail.com).

They also have lots of certified organic hop rhizomes available (they grow and use their own hops whenever possible), email them for details. Jeremy will be happy to give you a crash course on growing hops at home!

- [Hell Bay Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/Hellbaybrewing) is continuing their move to a bigger and better location, and will be selling out of their Liverpool location (38 Legion St) this weekend (Fri-Sun, 12-6pm each day). They will be having a Grand Opening mid-June to celebrate their move, and we will keep you up-to-date with the details. Congratulations to Hell Bay on their continued success!

- [Propeller Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/propellerbeer) is releasing their newest One Hit Wonder beer today. The style is an Imperial Red Ale, and unfortunately is only available in growlers at the brewery on Gottingen. Also, local drinks writer [Craig Pinhey](http://www.frogspad.ca/) has details on Propeller's expansion into Dartmouth in the latest edition of [Taps Magazine](http://tapsmagazine.com/in-this-issue/this-propeller-keeps-spinning/).

- [Garrison Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/garrisonbrewing) is also going through a major expansion in downtown Halifax, and we hope to give you some details on this soon. In the meantime, their much-anticipated Sugar Moon Maple beer is being released today at the brewery, and at [Premier Wine and Spirits](http://premierwines.ca/store/) and[ Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) this weekend. It will also be available at the ANBL shortly.

- Tickets for the afternoon session of the [Atlantic Beer Festival](http://www.atlanticbeerfestival.ca/Atlantic_Beer_Festival_New/Home.html) in Moncton on May 25th are still available. Breweries from all over the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and Maine will be in attendance. We hope to have the brewery and beer list for you soon.

- It's not for several months, but the Seaport Beer Festival has put out their [call for volunteers](http://seaportbeerfest.com/wp/?page_id=25). The festival is taking place in Halifax August 9-10, and volunteer spots fill up early, so contact them for more details.
