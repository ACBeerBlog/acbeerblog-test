[![peibeerfest](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/peibeerfest.jpg?w=194)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/peibeerfest.jpg)


This year's [Prince Edward Island Beer Festival](http://peibeerfest2014.com/), produced by the [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/), will be held on Friday and Saturday, Sept. 5th and 6th. We recently chatted with Alex Douglas, Director of Branding and Community Engagement with the PEI Brewing Co., to find out a few more details on the festival.

This is the first year that the festival will be held indoors, at the [Delta Prince Edward Hotel](https://www.deltahotels.com/Hotels/Delta-Prince-Edward). According to Douglas, this was a natural decision due to the unpredictability of weather and consequent protection from the elements. Also, the new ballroom where the festival will be held has a patio overlooking Peakes Quay, which should provide an enjoyable atmosphere for festival attendees.

There will be three tasting sessions over the weekend; two evening sessions, Friday and Saturday, from 6:30 - 9:30 pm, and a slightly shorter afternoon session on Saturday from 2:00 - 4:30 pm. Evening tickets are $40 (+tax and fee), and the afternoon tickets are $30 (+tax and fee). Tickets are still available; they can be purchased [online](https://www.festivalticketing.com/boxoffice/?cref=4a006000-5f21-4441-88ac-44b2d1208ae8), or in-person at the PEI Brewing Co. There are also discounted hotel & ticket packages available through the Delta; call to inquire (1-877-450-7752). We've been assured that Designated Driver tickets will also become available soon, for $15 online.

What does your ticket get you?

• Unlimited beer samples

• Live entertainment at each session (featuring several local bands; check out the beer fest web page for details)

• Voting in the Cask Contest

• Access to several on-site games

In regards to the Cask Contest, attending breweries have been invited to create a cask beer for the festival; festival goers will have the chance to try all cask offerings and vote on their favorite of the festival. Participating breweries in the contest will include PEI Brewing Co., [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/), [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons), and possibly more. As for the games, we don't have full details as to what they will entail, but Douglas said to expect "some classic East Coast-style party games to be played".

There will be food available for purchase from several vendors at the festival. No word as to which vendors will be participating yet, however, details should follow on the festival's website and social media links soon.

As for the beer, the mostly-completed brewery and beer list has been released on the festival's website. Atlantic Canadian breweries attending include PEI Brewing Co., Garrison, Picaroons, and [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/). Like last year, there will be over 75 different beers pouring, so attendees should have plenty to choose from.

Starting tonight, we'll be holding a contest to give away two tickets to the festival; any session, winner's choice! It's easy to enter... take a picture of any of the beers that will be at the festival, and Tweet it or share it to [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ACBeerBlog), with the hashtag **#PEIBeerFest**. Only one entry per person; the contest will begin immediately and continue until next Thursday, August 28th at 11:59 pm. That gives you a whole week, so don't miss out on your chance to win!

And remember, stay tuned to the festival's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/773336056065928/) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/peibeerfest) for more updates on food, entertainment, and beer over the next couple of weeks!
