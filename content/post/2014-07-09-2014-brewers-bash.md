We're only a few days away from this year's [Brewer's Bash](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) in Fredericton! Put on by [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons), the festival will be held this Saturday, July 12th from 11 am - 11 pm in downtown Fredericton at [Officer's Square](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Officers'+Square/@45.9618961,-66.6388415,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4ca418a3daea602d:0x3eac8ef84f86aff9). This is the second year for the outdoor event, and it promises to be at least as fantastic as last year! With about 60 breweries from across Canada present (about 1/3 of which are from Atlantic Canada), there will be over 300 beers pouring. With many of these beers typically not available in our region, the Bash offers a great excuse to get outside and enjoy a lot of new craft beer!

For entertainment, the outdoor festival will have a DJ spinning music throughout the day, and live tunes in the evening. Both [Cyndi Cain](http://cyndicain.com/) and [The Chronos Band](http://thechronosband.com/) will be performing; unfortunately, the also-scheduled [Zeus](http://themusicofzeus.com/) has had to cancel due to medical issues. Luckily, Cyndi Cain and Chronos have agreed to extend their sets, so there'll still be plenty of live music for your listening pleasure!

Ticket-holders can come and go as they please, but there will still be food options available at the festival. [Milda's](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mildas-PizzasMore/102816963127706) will be serving up some wood-fired pizzas, and [reLiSH](http://relishyou.ca/) will have several burgers available for purchase, including _The Brewster_, with lager onion chutney, cheddar cheese, and hickory sticks.

As for the beers and ciders that will be available, well, most breweries are keeping it a secret until the day of the festival. But, we've spoken with most of the brewers at the Atlantic Canadian breweries that are attending, and managed to get a sneak peek from many of them! Check out the list below:

Looks like plenty of great options, with lots of seasonals and one-offs joining regular-line-up beers! Like last year, the event sold out quickly (despite 500 more tickets being sold this year)... however, they announced this morning that they are holding another ticket giveaway contest later today. Keep an eye on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) for your chance to win! We hope to see you at the festival on Saturday!
