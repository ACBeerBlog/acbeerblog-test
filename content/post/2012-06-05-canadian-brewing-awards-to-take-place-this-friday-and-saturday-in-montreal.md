_Editor's Note:  Please note that the below post does not accurately identify which Atlantic Canadian breweries submitted beers for the Canadian Brewing Awards.  Propeller, and possibly others I had identified, did not submit beers for this competition.  I took this information from a page on the [Canadian Brewing Awards' website](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/canadian-breweries/) that identifies a list of Canadian Breweries.  As the list of breweries was incomplete (Rockbottom, Shiretown, Authentic Seacoast Brewing, Rudder's, Storm Brewing and Yellowbelly Brewery among the missing) and one was added to the list after I pointed out to their brewer that they were not included on the site (they had submitted for the competition) I figured the list was for breweries that submitted their beers.  Sorry for the confusion. _

The [2012 Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) will take place June 8th and 9th in Montreal in conjunction with the annual [Mondiale de la Biere](http://festivalmondialbiere.qc.ca/en/festivals/mondial_de_la_biere_montreal_2012/) Beer Festival.  This year's event marks the first time that the Awards ceremony will take place outside of Toronto and has expanded to include [technical workshops and guest speakers](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/technical-workshops/).

Of the [111 participanting Canadian breweries](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/canadian-breweries/), fourteen are Atlantic Canadian (Quidi Vidi Brewing Co., Garrison Brewing Co., Granite Brewery, Hart & Thistle, Paddy's Brewpub, Propeller Brewing Co., Rogue's Roost Brewpub, Sea Level Brewing Co., Acadie-Broue Inc., Big Tide Brewing Company, Moosehead Breweries Ltd., Picaroon's Traditional Ales (Northampton Brewing Company Ltd.), Pump House Brewery, and PEI Brewing Co. (a.k.a. Gahan's)).

Atlantic Canadian breweries have traditionally fared very well at the Awards.   Picaroon's was named Brewery of the Year last year with Pump House Brewery winning the Award in 2005.  Garrison won Beer of the Year in both 2007 and 2008 for its Imperial I.P.A.  At last year's event Picaroon's, Garrison, Pump House, Moosehead, Acadie-Broue and Gahan's (now known as the PEI Brewing Company) all came home with awards.

For those interested in watching the ceremonies but unable to attend in person, festival organizers have confirmed that you'll be able to watch the festivities live [from a link on the website during the event](www.canadianbrewingawards.com).

A future post will outline awards won by Atlantic Canadian breweries once results have been released.

Best of luck to Atlantic Canadian breweries at this year's event!
