The number of craft breweries in New Brunswick continues to rise, as [Bogtrotter Craft Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BogtrotterCraftBrewery/) quickly came on the scene earlier this month and announced that it would be opening soon in Fredericton. Owner and brewmaster Rod Croucher has been homebrewing for about 10 years, and has decided to take the first step in turning his hobby into a career. We recently chatted a little with Rod to find out more about the brewery, and his plans for when it launches next month.

**Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?**

I served in the military for 23 years, and I got out about 4 years ago. I retired in Alberta from the [PPCLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Patricia%27s_Canadian_Light_Infantry), and worked as a realtor in the province.  My wife and I then decided to move back home - I grew up in the Fredericton and Oromocto area, and have strong family ties to the area.

**How did you get into the world of craft beer?**

When I lived in Alberta, there was a huge selection of beers from around the world.

**What size/manufacturer/type of system will you be brewing on?**

Currently I am running the brewery myself out of my home. I have a 1 BBL (115 L) electric HERMS system, with 7 fermentors.

**When exactly do you plan on launching next month?**

I'm launching with three beers on Saturday, September 24th. We will be starting at the [Station (ANBL)](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Station) downtown with _Saturday Sips in the Afternoon_, followed by a stop at another establishment (hopefully, still working on the details), and finishing up with an event at the [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/JamesJoyceCP/?fref=ts) at 8:00 pm.

**What are your plans for distribution?**

My goal is to brew small batches of quality beer. My plan is to start in local restaurants and other licensees in the Fredericton area. We won't be licensed for on-site sales at this time.

**Do you have some initial accounts in the area lined up to serve your beers?**

I have talked to a few establishments in Fredericton, and there is definite interest in the products.

**Can you tell us about the beer(s) you plan on offering initially?**

I will be launching with the following three beers:

_Muddy Mayhem IPA_, an American IPA, 6.2% ABV, 85 IBUs, and dry-hopped.

_Angry Otter Pub Ale_, an Extra Special Bitter, 5% ABV, 45 IBUs.

_Osprey' Orange Pale Ale_, a light-coloured beer with additions of orange peel and coriander seed, 5% ABV, 40 IBUs.

**Where do you hope to see your brewery in the next 2-3 years?**

I would love to expand to a tap house depending on the response I get to my beers; hopefully this happens within a year or so.

**Do you have a favourite beer style, beer, or brewery you enjoy drinking?**

I’m a self-proclaimed hop head - IPAs and Imperial IPAs are my favourite styles - so anything with high IBUs and hops flavour works for me.

_We wish Rod the best of luck with his new brewery, and look forward to Bogtrotter's launch next month! We'll let you know more about the launch-day events in a few weeks; in the meantime, be sure to follow Bogtrotter on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BogtrotterCraftBrewery/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bogtrotter2016), for updates on their progress._
