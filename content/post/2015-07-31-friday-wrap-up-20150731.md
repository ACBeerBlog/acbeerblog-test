Happy Friday, Beer Fans! The weather is finally improving around our parts, and we've got lots of hoppy news to go with it; let's dive right in!

• [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/) opened earlier this week at [6041 North Street](https://goo.gl/VwfsOQ) in Halifax. They currently have three beers pouring in their retail location, _Hoppy Fingers_ APA (4.8% ABV and 25 IBUs), _Exile on North Street_ IPA (6.5% ABV and 65 IBUs), and _Twelve Years to Zion_ DIPA (8.0% ABV, 100+ IBUs). For those with celiac disease and other gluten sensitivities, their _Exile on North Street_ was treated to reduce the gluten present in the final beer, and has been tested to be less than 5ppm. Their retail location is open 12-8pm Tuesday-Saturday, 12-6pm Sunday. And for those who are getting anxious to enjoy some pints of Unfiltered **AT** Unfiltered, fear not, work continues on their tap room adjacent to the brewery. Congratulations on the opening, to the entire Unfiltered Family!

• To celebrate next week's upcoming annual International IPA Day (Thursday, August 6th), [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) will be releasing their first IPA. _White Noize_ is being dubbed a "Wheat IPA" (think hoppy American Wheat Ale), as half of its grist is Wheat malt. Hopped with plenty of 'C' hops (including **Centennial**, **Cascade**, **Chinook**, and **Columbus**) to 70 IBUs, this 7% ABV ale should feature plenty of citrus and dank notes. Look for it to be released next Thursday at the brewery's taproom for growler fills and pints; they'll also have it on cask, along with their regular-release APA, _Do-Gooder_.

• [Pump House Brewery](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) in Moncton has released a new seasonal beer, _Rose Hip Ale_. This 4.5% ABV beer was brewed with rose hips, local to the region, with a distinct floral and citrus aroma, and full of vitamin C. Orange peel was also used in the brew to complement the hips. The colour is a golden copper tone, stemming from specialty malts and the orange colour of the rose hips - no artificial colourings were used. The beer will be available at both the the ANBL and NSLC shortly.

• Also new from Pump House this week, is _Strawberry Wheat Ale_. This is a limited-supply, "German-style, unfiltered wheat beer" that features "banana-like" esters, similar to your typical Hefeweizen. However, the beer also had an addition of over 40 kg of real strawberries, giving it a "lingering, strawberry-tart finish", according to the brewery. Coming in at 5.2% ABV, it has a very low bitterness at 9 IBUs. You can find it on tap at the brewpub in Moncton, select beer bars and restaurants across NB and NS, and at the Dieppe ANBL growler station this weekend.

• There's a new beer on tap from [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf) in Fredericton, which was just released yesterday. _ESB-231_ was brewed to celebrate the New Brunswick Day long weekend (starting... today!), and features all NB malts and hops. This Extra Special Bitter is "moderately-malty, and moderately-hopped" with both **Cascade** and **Centennial**. Recipe-wise, it's actually quite similar to their regular-release _Best Bitter_, but aside from all-local ingredients, this batch was also dry-hopped in the fermentor. This quite-limited 6.2% ABV British-style ale will also be pouring at all four ANBL growler stations this weekend.

• While on the topic of the NB Day long weekend, let's review what's going on, beer-wise, in the province over the next few days! The [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/FoodatTheCrownDowntown) "[18 Lines, 18 NB Breweries](https://www.facebook.com/events/511961148955651/)" event starts today at 3 pm, and it has actually been increased to **19 taps**, as newcomer Half Cut released their first beer last Friday! No tickets for entry required, just be sure to show up over the weekend to try a plethora of NB-brewed beers! Keep in mind they're also open on Sunday for this weekend. There's still some [tickets](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/fredericton-beer-run-2015-tickets-14099759761) left for the 3rd annual [Fredericton Beer Run](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonBeerRun?fref=ts); with 18 breweries pouring around 40 beers, cider, and mead after the running portion of the event, it's the perfect way to exercise and indulge at the same time! Check out our [previous post](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/06/12/friday-wrap-up-20150612/) for more details. And to top it off, all four ANBL growler stations will feature NB-brewed beers, including [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) _Covered Bridge ESB_ at the KV location, [Railcar](http://railcarbrewing.com/) _Grapefruit Pale Ale_ in Fredericton, and [Fils du Roy](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/) _Caraquet Flyer_ in Sackville, to name a few. Check the full list [here](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf).

• If you hadn't pre-ordered tickets for the [Sunset Heights Meadery](https://www.facebook.com/SunsetHeightsMeadery) [Autumn Mead Release Party](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/sunset-heights-meadery-autumn-mead-release-party-tickets-17574265100) (being held Saturday, October 24th from 5-9 pm at the Crowne Plaza), good news! They will be releasing the few remaining tickets online this Sunday, starting at 9 am. The event features special-release meads, a "Local Harvest Meal", a collectible glass, and the right to purchase up to 24 bottles of mead. Tickets are extremely limited (only seven remaining), so be sure to grab yours while you can!

• Over on the Rock, [YellowBelly](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) has a new beer on tap - _Robert the Spruce_ is a Pale Ale that has been brewed with spruce tips. Golden-amber in color, it clocks in at 5.5% ABV. While having a calculated bitterness of only 28 IBUs, the perceived bitterness is actually much higher due to the use of the spruce tips, according to the brewery. Look for bottles of this one to be available at the brewery and select NLC stores by the end of next week.

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has a pair of new brews on at their Marginal Rd location these days. The first is _Trop Yard Radler_, a blend of their _Hop Yard Pale Ale _and with fresh lime and orange juice. Despite the low ABV (3.4%), the blend packs a punch of tropical fruit character and solid bitterness. It is available at the brewery for growler fills and on-site sampling. The second beer is called _Fluffernutter. _It is a special batch of their _Nut Brown Ale_, infused with marshmallows, which lend a slight sweetness to the beer, as well as their distinctive aroma and taste. The _Fluffernutter_ is 5% ABV, and due to its limited availability, is only available for onsite consumption at the brewery. Get down there today for a taste before its all gone!

• [The Nook and Cranny](http://thenookandcranny.ca/) in Truro has brewed up a new beer. _NovelTea Passionfruit Ale_ is based on their Wheat Ale, with some special additions. After fermentation, 22 litres of steeped Satya Tea blend [Berry Bliss](https://www.satyatea.com/shop/herbal-tea/berry-bliss-herbal-tea) was added to the beer. It is a blend of dried chamomile, chicory root, hibiscus flowers, rose hips, and strawberries. In addition to the tea, puréed passion fruit is added to the beer for additional tart, bitter, and citrus characteristics. Look for the beer to be on tap shortly, for pints in the pub, and growlers to go.

• The brewery and beer list for next weekend's [Seaport Beerfest](http://seaportbeerfest.com/breweries) (Aug 7-8) was released this morning. They will be featuring plenty of Maritime, Quebec, Ontario, and Maine breweries, as well as several Irish breweries again this year. The extremely popular Cask Beer Pavillion will be making a return, with an expanded lineup. The [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/) will be operating that Pavillion, and the Fest and LBL will be donating to Adsum House. This year's special guest is Gráinne Walsh of [Metalman Brewing](http://www.metalmanbrewing.com/) in Waterford, Ireland. If you haven't already purchased your tickets, you are not too late! [Tickets for all sessions are still available](http://seaportbeerfest.com/tickets), including the Friday night VIP session, which includes a limited edition sampling glass and opener, participation in a Q&A session with a brewer's panel, guided tasting of a few brews, and early access to the Fest. For those of you who like to travel in packs, tomorrow is the last day to take advantage of the group discount option, for groups of 15 or more. [Email Joanne](http://mailto:joanne@seaportbeerfest.com) for more information.

• The [Moncton Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/MonctonBeerLeague) is holding another beer and food pairing that features Nova Scotia beer, on Friday, August 28th from 7-10 pm. Early-bird tickets are [on sale now](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/flights-n-bites-ns-craft-beer-edition-tickets-17853199400) until August 4th, and are $39 + fee.
