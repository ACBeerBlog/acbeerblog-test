I'm more than a little late getting around to posting about this (and seeing growlers for each at yesterday's Seaport Beerfest was a subtle reminder) but both Rogue's Roost and Rockbottom Brewpub now offer their beers for sale in growlers.

At Rogue's Roost [the initial purchase of a filled up growler cost $19.95 taxes included and refills go for $11.95](http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/121158-rogues-roost-biggie-brew-to-go).

At Rockbottom [growlers go for $8 and can be filled for $13 or $14 depending on which beer you purchase](http://www.facebook.com/RockbottomBrewpubRestaurant/posts/456479727715698).
