## 


Introduce the people in an opening paragraph, so we can drop the "partners" question. Can explain their relationship in this paragraph. Maybe also talk about "what steps have you taken thus far": "Just announced", "Opening Soon", "Has Been Open for 2 years", etc.



- Can you tell us a little bit about yourselves?

- How did you get into the world of beer?

- What made you decide to take the step into opening a brewery?

- What is the culture or ethos of the brewery?

- Do you have an approximate openingÂ date?

- Can you tell us about the beers you plan on offering initially? Any seasonals or one-offs in the works?

- What are your plans for distribution? Plans for tap accounts, bottles, growlers, etc.? Will you be licensed for on-site sales or consumption at the brewery?

- Do you have some initial accounts in the area lined up to serve your beers?

- Have you had any assistance from other breweries/people in Atlantic Canada (or elsewhere)?

- Where do you hope to see your brewery in the next 2-3 years?

Brewer/Brewery specific:

- What size/manufacturer/type of system will you be brewing on? Expected output (monthly, yearly, etc)?

- Care to share some info on your homebrewing history (if applicable)?

- Do you have a favorite beer style, beer, or brewery you enjoy drinking?

- How about favourite style or ingredient to brew with?


- Do you have a website, facebook, instagram, and/or twitter page?


If you have a high quality logo, and any pictures of the brewery, system, etc, we'd love to include them in the post.


Anything else you'd like to share, we'd love pass it along.
