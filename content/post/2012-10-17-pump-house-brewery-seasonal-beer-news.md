[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pumphouse1.png)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pumphouse1.png)Pump House Brewery recently [released its first batches of bottled seasonal beers:  Thai Wheat and Oktoberfest](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/08/pump-house-brewery-oktoberfest-thai-wheat-and-sample-variety-packs-now-available-in-new-brunswick-and-nova-scotia/).  Plans are now under way for its next offerings.

A Doppelbock is being planned for release in early December.  The beer is planned to be 10% ABV to tie into Pump House's 10th anniversary of bottling their beer.  Pump House is also planning on releasing Maple Ale in bottles next Spring.

As they are just starting out with bottling seasonal beers, they want to get a sense as to how they sell before determining how many and which beers they will bottle on a regular basis.
