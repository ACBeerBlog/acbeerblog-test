Hot off of releasing [v3.0 of Hop Mess Monster ](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/23/hop-mess-monster-v3-0-available-at-hart-and-thistle-tuesday-july-24th-at-5pm/)at Hart & Thistle earlier this week, [Rockstar Brewer Greg Nash](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/q-a-with-atlantic-canadas-rock-star-brewer-greg-nash/) is bringing something very original to the Halifax beer scene.  Available at 11am tomorrow at Rockbottom is [Hasukappu Weisse](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2012/07/hasukappu-weisse.html).

The brew is made Haskap berry (the first commercially available beer brewed with Haskap in North America) and Rockbottom's German-style hefeweizen.

The new brew described:


<blockquote>The spicy phenols of our classic hefeweizen combine with the tartness of the Haskap in the finish, acidic and very refreshing. This is a great homegrown summer treat. And don't be surprised to find a little blue nugget in your glass, the berries make for an excellent garnish.</blockquote>


Two versions of the brew have been created.  Version one is available on taps now with version 2 (the final version of the beer) available shortly.

Additional information on the berry is available on the [Rockbottom Brewer's Blog](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2012/07/hasukappu-weisse.html).
