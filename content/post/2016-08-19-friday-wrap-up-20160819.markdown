Happy Friday everyone! Lots of news this week, so let's get right to it...




• Leading us off today is a story from Halifax's [Unfiltered Brewing](http://hoppyasballs.ca): they have filed suit against the [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/), arguing that the "Retail Mark-Up Sales Allocation" the Crown Corporation is unconstitutional. When Unfiltered's lawyers consulted the legislation to learn more about the mark-up, none could be found, and the NSLC has been unable to provide documents outlining the details. The $0.50/litre mark-up is applied to all NS-made beer that is sold or given away, whether or not it hits any NSLC retail stores. Unfiltered is claiming that the mark-up is in fact a tax, and that the NSLC is not legislated to collect it. They are requesting reimbursement for the more than $25,000 paid to the NSLC over the last 13 months, and that the mark-up be declared unconstitutional. This case has wide-reaching implications, as all of the more than 35 breweries in the province have been paying this fee for years, and would amount to many millions of dollars that could be at dispute. From the NSLC's own spokesperson, $954,000 was collected in 2015, of which $50,000 was provided to the [Craft Brewers Association of Nova Scotia](http://nscraftbeer.ca) (the association of 25 member breweries, but Unfiltered is not one of them). The scheduling of the suit is to be decided in early September, and we'll be sure to keep you up to date with all of the news. [The CBC has a good summary of the details of the suit](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/unfiltered-beer-brewing-nova-scotia-nslc-lawsuit-markup-fee-craft-brewery-1.3721655).




• In new beer news, Fredericton's [TrailWay Brewing](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) has dropped a new take on their fruit wheat beer this week: _Haskap Wheat_. With a similar base as their _Raspberry Wheat_, this beer features 40 kilos of locally-grown [Haskap](http://haskap.ca/) berries added after fermentation. The resultant beer is a hazy purple colour, with notes of blueberry, raspberry, and cranberry, on a pleasant wheat base. A very drinkable 4.3% ABV and 20 IBUs Wheat beer. And speaking of drinkable, their South Pacific-hopped Pale Ale _D'under_ is back again, weighing in at 5.5% ABV and approximately 40 IBUs from late addition hops. Lots of tropical aromas come through from the hops, without a big bitter blast.




• [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released their latest **One Hit Wonder** this week, and their Brewmaster apparently had a one-track mind when it came to this recipe! _1 Hop IPA_ is a 6.6% ABV and 56 IBUs beer, featuring nothing but **Mandarina Bavaria** for the hopping. As the name implies, this hop was developed in Germany, at the [Hop Research Institute](http://www.hopfenforschung.de/sites/wirueberuns3_forschung_engl.html) in Hüll, and is among the recent wave of aromatic hops (higher oil content) coming from Europe. The orange and citrus notes of the hop shine through on top of the robust body and significant bitterness. As with all of their OHW releases, this is only available in draft, or for growler fills at their two brewery locations. And while you're at the brewery, be sure to check out Prop's first can release. They have started with their flagship _IPA_, with cans now available at their retail locations, and will soon be rolling out to the private stores and NSLC shelves.





 • [Gahan House Halifax](http://halifax.gahan.ca/) has a few new beers on tap currently, and a brand new beer hitting the taps next week. Now on tap are: _Maritime Brine_, a 3.8% Gose with a light acidity and salt character, along with pleasant lemon character, with just enough hops (less than 10 IBUs) to keep it balanced; _The Barberrian_ (which made its cask debut at the Seaport Beer Festival), a 5.0% ABV Red Ale aged on dried barberries and cherries, for a bright fruit flavour and aroma; _Summer House Beer_, a 4.0% Hefeweizen dry-hopped with **Mt Hood** for a hoppy-aromatic take on the style; and _Crosscurrent_, their 5.5% ABV American Pale Ale with **El Dorado** and **Simcoe**. On tap for next week is _Night Vision_, a 6.2% American Porter, using **Magnum** and **Mt Hood** hops (to about 30 IBUs), featuring "chocolate and graham cracker notes" as a nice contrast to their roast-forward _Stout_, according to Brewmaster Kyle Jeppesen. Be sure to follow along with his adventures on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jep_brews/), to keep up-to-date on his brew days and what's coming up on the waterfront. In fact, Jeppesen just brewed a [_Sahti_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahti), his take on the traditional Finnish brew, featuring locally-harvest juniper branches used in the mash, and a large percentage of rye malt.




• [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) is releasing a special beer collaboration brew today, _Lawrencetown Blonde_. This 4.5% ABV beer features 2-Row and Wheat malts, and lightly hopped with **Cascade** and **Saaz** to about 20 IBUs. Surfing friends of the brewery, Ian Jackson and Dean Petty (of [Anchored Coffee](http://www.anchoredcoffee.com/)) were also part of the brewday, label design, and recipe development. Ten litres of Ethiopian Yukro cold brew was added to the final beer, courtesy of Anchored, for a light roastiness to complement the peach, citrus, and light ginger aromas. And a nod to the surfers was a little but of Lawrencetown Beach sea water too! Ian's wife Jill (of [Jill+Jack Paper](https://www.instagram.com/jillandjackpaper/)) designed the label, on the bottles which are available on both Agricola and Ochterloney today.




• [Yellowbelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St John's has released a new beer this week, _Southern Shore Foggy Porter_. This deep-ruby-coloured porter features a big roast character, notes of toast and smoke, and dry finish, thanks to the large percentage of roasted barley used in the recipe. Dry-hopped with **Brewer's Gold**, **Cascade**, and **Mosaic** to enhance the nose with a touch of spice and fruit. This beer is Brewmaster Liam Mckenna's tribute to "the finest sort of folks down the Shore who endure weather like no others, [and] will warm the cockles." The 5.8% ABV, 45 IBUs, beer is on tap at the brewpub now, and may not make it into bottles, so best to drop by for a pint today!




• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has brought back their popular _Honey Lavender Ale_ today. The 6.5% ABV beer features lavender harvested from [Meander River Farms](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/), and its aroma is a pleasant partner to the malt and light honey character. Honey from Shubenacadie's [G.G. Smeltzer & Son](http://selectnovascotia.ca/business/gg-smeltzer-and-son) helped to bump up the alcohol a bit, aiding the Maritime Malt and Wheat, and does offer a sweet aftertaste. A small dose of **Citra** hops helps to offset the beer at a light 16 IBUs. Bottles are now available at the brewery and private stores in HRM.




• Nyanza's [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) has brought back their kettle-soured IPA this week, _JAC the SIPA_. Featuring loads of **Amarillo**, **Citra**, and **Simcoe** hops added during a whirlpool after flame-out, this 6.0% ABV beer features a big aromatic blast of hops with a medium 54 IBUs. The acidic nature of the beer gives a pleasant refreshing sharp character, on a hot afternoon.







• [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) will be pouring a special beer this weekend, to celebrate [The Tragically Hip](http://www.thehip.com/home/)'s [final concert](http://www.cbcmusic.ca/) (and Canada-wide phenomenon). _The Tragically Hop'd _Pale Ale is a 4.5% ABV Pale Ale with "silly" amounts of some special hops: **Galaxy**, **Saphir**, **Summit**, **Topaz**, **Vic Secret**, and **Warrior**, to 40 IBUs. The beer will be pouring exclusively at the "Fully Completely in the Square" event in Fredericton's Officer Square, at the Brewtique, and at the General Store in Saint John tomorrow, August 20th.

Speaking of events, there are a whole bunch of them on our radar in the coming weeks.

• Mahone Bay's [Saltbox Brewing](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) will be opening their retail location **August 20** for growler and merchandise sales, 10-4. They will be selling their _Dark Cream Ale_, a flavourful 4.7% golden orange ale featuring notes of biscuit and toast and their _IPA_, a 5.4% dry-hopped hoppy ale, featuring notes of melon and strawberry. As they are still awaiting their 12 hl brewhouse to come online (much of it [was delivered this week!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJQgArqhG_q/)), they will be concentrating on to-go sales, in both their own, or customer-provided (**clean**), grunters and growlers. Their current schedule is to be open for take away sales for the next few Saturdays until their launch at the end of September.

• The [Upstreet Block Party](https://www.facebook.com/events/1739910369630353/) is returning for its second year on **Saturday, August 20th**.

As the sun goes down, the party will move into the taproom at about 8 pm for more music (from two local DJs), food, and beer. Admission is free, just drop in anytime to join in the fun!

• On **August 26th** Quebec Belgian-inspired brewery [Unibroue](http://www.unibroue.com/) is sending their Beer Sommelier (and [Certified Cicerone®](https://www.cicerone.org/)) Sylvain Bouchard to The Port, NSLC's new flagship location at 5485 Clyde Street. He will be helping to launch the release of the 6-litre _17 Grand Reserve_ Belgian Strong, with a food and beer tasting with several of their products (including _Éphémère Apple, Blonde de Chambly, La Fin du Monde, Maudite_, in addition to the _17_) . There are only 32 bottles of this special beer, in a format best suited for sharing at a wedding or other celebration, and those in attendance will have the first chance at trying and purchasing them. There are only 30 tickets available to the 7-8:30pm event (on sale at The Port now), and we are holding a **contest** for your chance to win a pair of them! Post a picture to our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ACBeerBlog/?fref=ts) page, and/or tag us and @Unibroue on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ACBeerBlog) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/acbeerblog/), with a picture your **favourite beer and food pairing**, and we will announce the winner in our Weekly Wrap-Up next Friday morning.

•  On **August 26 & 27**, [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/) is hosting a tap takeover from Portland Maine's [Liquid Riot Bottling Co](http://liquidriot.com/).

The fun starts Friday night at 6pm on Barrington, with a dozen sours, porters, wheats, and IPAs taking over the taps at the Mothership, and continues Saturday from noon at the Beer Garden on Spring Garden, with ten taps of LR goodness (five of which are exclusive to the BG). There are no tickets required for the fun, and there are only single kegs of many of the beers, so be sure and drop by early to avoid disappointment!
