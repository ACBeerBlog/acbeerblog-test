Happy Friday everyone! As we quickly approach Canada Day, remember to grab a local craft beer and celebrate!

• [Propeller Brewing Co](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released their latest One-Hit Wonder Beer, _Rye IPA_. Brewed at the Gottingen Street brewhouse, this beer features 2-Row, Crystal, and Rye malt, and significant bitterness and citrus nose from the Falconers Flight hop. This beer weighs in at 6.7% ABV and 68 IBUs, and 15 SRM. Don't look for this one in bottles, it is only available in growlers at the Halifax and Dartmouth Prop Shop locations, as well as on tap at [Field Guide](http://fieldguidehfx.com/), [Freeman's Pizza](http://www.freemanspizza.ca/), [The Henry House](http://www.henryhouse.ca/), [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) and [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/). As with all of their One-Hit Wonder brews, this beer won't last long, so seek it out today! And don't forget that the [Cheese Gypsy](http://cheesegypsy.ca) Food Truck will be at the Dartmouth brewery today from 11:30-2:30, to round out your lunch.

• [Uncle Leo's Brewing Co](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/) has released a new beer, _Vohs Weizenbier_. This German Wheat beer is brewed with approximately 50% wheat malt for a very light colour, and a characteristic hazy appearance. More of a showcase of the yeast aromas than hops, this beer weighs in at 5% ABV and 14 IBUs. The beer was brewed as a tribute to the Whiffen's friends Matt and Brenda Vohs, who own [Piper's Landing Restaurant](http://www.piperslandingrestaurant.com/), neighbours to the Brewery. Matt previously brewed at a brewery in Cologne, Germany, and Piper's was the first spot to have Uncle Leo's on tap. With two new 10 bbl fermenters in the brewery, we're looking forward to more tributes and collaborations in the future! And be sure to pop your growlers in a special bag, designed by local craftsperson Charlotte MacCuish, made from Uncle Leo's empty grain sacks, also available at the [New Glasgow Farmers Market](https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Glasgow-Farmers-Market-Cooperative/213341165357086).

• As we mentioned [last week](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/friday-wrap-up-6/), Bad Apple Brewhouse will be taking over the taps and casks at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) on July 5th. We are able to release the full tap list now, so begin salivating!
_Apple Cider _(weighing in at 7.7%),_ Summer Slurper_ (a 5.0% session beer), _Dry-hopped APA_ (5.7% ABV), _East Coast Beer_ (Sea Salt and Caramel, 6.0% ABV, brewed with dulse and aged on cedar), _Mother Pucker Sour Ale_ (4.8% ABV),  _That's Falcon Teamwork IPA_ (6.7% ABV, a second release of the very popular beer brewed with Greg Nash and the Stillwell crew), _White Side Up White IPA_ (6.5%), the last keg of _Mosaic Double IPA_ (8.0% ABV, full story [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/13/friday-wrap-up-20140613/)), _Impresser DIPA_ (10.2%), _Black and Tackle Russian Imperial Stout_ (9% ABV),  _Hopscotch Barrel-aged DIPA_ (10%ABV), _Barrel-aged RIS_ (11.6%), _Smokehouse Lager_ (6.7% ABV, brewed with 100% smoked malt), and _APA_ (5.7% ABV).
Tickets for the three sessions (noon-3pm, 4-7, and 8-11, with a DJ spinning records) have been selling fast, so be sure to grab your tickets at Stillwell today.

• Another new Hefeweizen has hit Nova Scotia, as [Rogues Roost](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) also has one on tap at the brewpub. Coming in at 5.4% ABV and 15 IBUs, the brewpub describes the ester and phenolic notes as moderate, smelling "of fresh white bread, with a lemon pith tartness", which should make for an enjoyable, refreshing beer for the hot weather. Look for a German Pilsner to be coming down the line soon, as they plan on brewing one up next week! More on that in the near future.

• After a busy couple of weeks at their Main Street storefront, [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) will be setting up shop at the [Truro Farmers' Market](http://www.trurofarmersmarket.org/) tomorrow. They will be debuting their 650mL bottle format, and both the _Hippie Dippie Pale Ale_ and _Butcher Block Red_ will be available.

• Only a year after moving to their new location at [96 Kensington Rd.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/96+Kensington+Rd/@46.252668,-63.1153749,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4b5e52be39678e25:0x2def3dc28e2964fa) in Charlottetown, the [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) has added some new equipment. They just installed a 150 bbl (4,650 U.S. gallons, or ~175 hL) fermentor in their brewery. The addition comes at just the right time, as they've recently increased their availability across Alberta, with over 75 beer stores/restaurants/bars now carrying their beers in that province.

• [BarNone](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) has rebrewed their _RedEye PA_, a hoppy Amber that was originally brewed a few months ago for the 150-hour music festival held in Charlottetown, and in celebration of the 150th Anniversary of the Charlottetown Conference. This time, the 6% ABV, 150 IBU beer was brewed for the upcoming [Summerside Lobster Festival](http://summersidelobsterfest.com/), being held from July 14th to 19th. No word on whether there have been any changes to the recipe, so we assume it involves the same specs as last time (check our [original post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/friday-wrap-up/) for more info).

• Nackawic's [Big Axe Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery) recently announced that they're now licensed to sell their beers by the glass, at the brewery/B&B. Now you can stop by [519 Otis Dr.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/519+Otis+Dr/@45.9736053,-67.2415564,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4ca45b2330915c69:0xc8a54f4cada252ee) to try out what they have on tap; they are, of course, still filling growlers for takeaway as well.

• If you weren't able to get tickets to the now sold-out [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons)' [Brewer's Bash](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) on July 12th, they're currently holding a contest on Facebook. All you have to do is post your favorite Canadian craft beer, and you'll be entered in their random draw to win two tickets. Hurry over, the contest ends today at 2 pm. And a final reminder that there's still a few spots open for volunteers; if you're interested, don't wait any longer! Send them an [email](mailto:volunteer<at>picaroons.ca) while you still can.

Have a great weekend, and enjoy the fine weather!
