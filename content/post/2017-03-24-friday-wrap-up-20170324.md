If you’ve been paying attention to the calendar, you know that Spring has arrived in Atlantic Canada. That said, if you’ve been paying attention to the actual weather, what with school closures twice this week in parts of the province and some bitter cold towards the end of the week, you may be considering taking a _Caddyshack_ approach to the groundhog’s report next year. Embarrassingly stereotypical carping aside, the weather hasn’t stopped our region’s breweries from continuing to pound out tasty beers to soothe our chapped lips and frostbitten livers. We’re going to start this week’s report with news from the amateur side of brewing, where a couple of local homebrew competitions have announced their winners…

• This past Sunday afternoon, [Bar Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) was taken over by the finale of the [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) **Black Box Challenge 2017**. Six finalists, whose beers had been previously selected by beer judges from a pool of 23 (of a possible 25) entries, showed up to make a case for why they should take home the coveted trophy this year. The presentations ranged from the straight-up and matter-of-fact to a brewday video, to a two-man sound effect-laden comedy sketch and a mandolin-soaked musical performance. In the end, and for the second year running, the trophy went to Halifax home brewer Brian Harvey (aka 1029 Brewing). His beer was a Orange peel-infused kettle-soured ale entitled _Grafted_. Also placing were Jayme Keddy and Gavin Stewart (aka Delta Force Brewing) with their Northeastern IPA, _Bad Example for the Others_ in second place, and Steve Crane with a Bière de Garde he called _Meteor that Killed the Dinosaurs_ in third. Rounding out the top six were Kelly Costello (of the [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) family), who’s been brewing a scant 21 weeks but who achieved the highest tasting score for her Belgian IPA _Grand Mariner_, the kilted Jason Currie and his _Jeepers Peepers Springtime Stout_ in the rare Tropical Stout style, and Marc Perry and Dave Wamback of Shelburne, one of whom was brewing all-grain for the first time and the other who had never brewed before, with their Black IPA, _Fish Cop Pop_. As is traditional, the winner’s beer will be brewed at Boxing Rock’s production brewery and made available to the public; but if you were paying attention last year you know that the top three were all brewed and this year Boxing Rock President Henry Pedro suggested he was impressed enough that he may not stop at three! We’ll be sure to keep you appraised of releases of any and all Black Box Challenge 2017 brews here.

• In more homebrewing news, [Garrison Brewing's](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) **2017 Home Brew-Off** Gala was last night, and we have all of the results. This year's style was **Wee Heavy**, and from more than forty entries, three rounds of judging, Fredericton homebrewer Roger Ringuette took home top honours. Second Place went to Mark Power, Third to Ashley Kinsman, and Runner-Up Steve Proulx, all scoring well in yesterday afternoon's final round of blind judging. Roger will be brewing his recipe on Garrison's brewhouse early next year, for release in March 2018.

• Last night also served as the launch of the 2016 Garrison Home Brew-Off winning **Experimental IPA**, _Infusion Confusion_ Chamomile IPA brewed by local home brewer Mark Power (yes, a finalist in this year's competition as well!). Featuring Maritime Pale Ale malt, along with Honey, Munich, and Carapils malts to round out the grain bill, the 6.3% ABV beer uses **Amarillo**, **Cascade**, and **Citra** hops to achieve 50 IBUs. The mind-bending chamomile flowers were added during the brew-day, as well as conditioning (post-fermentation), to preserve the unique flavour and aromatic characteristics. It is available at the brewery retail shop in 650ml bottles today, with stock at the [NSLC](http://mynslc.com), and [NLC](http://nlliquor.com/),  in the near future.

• Rounding out the Garrison news are a pair of returning favourites: _In Session_ ISA (India Session Ale) has returned to the lineup for the year. This 4.5% ABV beer is light in alcohol, but big in citrus and tropical fruit flavour with lots of late hopping from **Belma**, **Crystal**, and **El Dorado**, for 30 IBUs of bittering. Remember that the later hops are used in the brewing process, the less bitterness is achieved, but more aroma and flavour is kept. Grab a sixpack at the brewery today, or from your local NSLC in early April. Also returning is the **Backlot Bash**, Garrison's epic all-evening concert event in the backlot of their production brewery. This year's event is happening **June 17th**, and features headliners [The Sheepdogs](http://www.thesheepdogs.com/), with [Port Cities](http://portcities.ca/), Garret Mason, and [The Royal Volts](https://www.facebook.com/theroyalvolts/), and is coinciding with Garrison's 20th birthday. Onsite there will plenty of games, Food Trucks, and of course Garrison beer, plus local cider. The whole event is in support of the [Ecology Action Centre](https://ecologyaction.ca/), and Early-Bird Tickets are [on sale now](http://www.tickethalifax.com/events/42128787/2017-backlot-bash)!

• Continuing with more from the world of homebrewing, last week we told you that HRM homebrew supply store [Everwood Avenue Brewshop](https://www.everwoodavebrewshop.com/) is moving to a new retail storefront and this week we’ve got more details to share with you. The new space is located at 731 Old Sackville Road in Lower Sackville and will be sporting regular retail hours six days a week, 10-6 on most days Tuesday to Sunday, with extended hours into the evenings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Everwood owner Dave Gillette says the space is close to twice as large as his previous digs, an expansion he expects will help him increase the demographics served by the business as well as the product lines. Expect to see more beginner equipment (especially introductory kits), commercial kegs, stainless steel conicals in the range of 7 gallons to a full 1 barrel and, later in the year, the possibility of full-on turnkey brewing systems. Dave is hoping to open the doors on **Tuesday, April 4th**, so if you’re a homebrewer and especially a fan of Everwood, give a thought to heading out and saying hi to Dave in his new spot! And a quick note that Dave is still looking to hire a retail associate, be sure to reach out to him via email, phone, or social media to find out more.

**And now for your regularly scheduled beer release news...**

• Listen up, [2 Crows fans](http://2crowsbrewing.com/) - there's several new beers out/coming out from Halifax's newest brewery, so let's start plowing through! First up is Linnea, a "Finnish Imperial Stout" (history buffs may get that) weighing in at a heavy 9.1% ABV (and 62 IBUs). Aside from having the typical jet black appearance, thick mouthfeel, and plenty of roasted flavours seen in Imperial Stouts, some liquorice root, star anise, salt, and cardamom pods were added at flameout to mimic Salmiakki, a popular Finnish candy that is essentially very salty black liquorice. _Linnea_ was tapped early this week as a very limited supply, so it may already be gone... but if not, grab some, quickly! Rumour has it a couple more small kegs may pop up at future events...

• Next up from 2 Crows is _Fantacity_, a dry-hopped Witbier. Described by the brewery as "citrusy, bright, juicy, and refreshing", it was fermented cool with the Saison strain (grown up from a bottle of [De Blaugies](http://www.brasseriedeblaugies.com/) _La Moneuse_) used for the brewery's _Innisfree_. With coriander and orange peel added at the end of the boil, and a heavy dry-hop addition of **Citra**, we probably don't have to tell you what aromas and flavours to expect with this one! Highly quaffable at 5.1% ABV and 13 IBUs, this was brewed as a larger batch, so is available for pints and growlers at the brewery. Look for it to pop up at several bars in the HRM as well, if it hasn't already.

• This coming weekend, 2 Crows will be releasing *another* new brew, _Midnight Mood_. Described as an American dry-hopped Porter, this 6.6% ABV, 39 IBUs beer is "roasty, dank, piney, and smooth". Hopped with **Bramling Cross**, **Chinook** and **Columbus**, and then heavily dry-hopped with **Simcoe**, the pine and citrus from all those hops "helps brighten the roastiness" from the dark malts. A Brett-fermented version should be following sometime next week, one that was dry-hopped with **Calypso** and **Citra**, and that has an earthy, dry, and slightly funky flavour profile, "with an almost smokey character to it". Be sure to get down to the brewery to give these beers a try! Also, keep your eyes on the 2 Crows social media - and this blog, of course - for more updates from the brewery, as they plan on releasing new pilot batches fairly regularly for the next while, including one keg of a "Sunflower Seed Brett Saison" that features a kilo of sunflower seeds that were home-malted by brewmaster Jeremy Taylor!

• [Meander River](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) released a new beer late last week, and we've got the details for you now. _Barn Swallow Farmhouse Ale_ was brewed entirely with [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) malt, a 70/30 mix of Pale and Munich. Mashed "long and slow" over a wide temperature range, the beer was fermented with a dry Belgian yeast strain, and then dry-hopped with **Pacific Gem**, a New Zealand variety. The result is a 5.5% ABV, dry, golden-coloured ale with fruit and spice in the aroma and taste, "alongside a mild-but-present hop character". Look for it this weekend at the brewery and Forum Farmers Market.

• [Hammond River](http://hrbrewing.ca/) owner/brewer Shane Steeves may be away in sunny Cuba this week, but luckily for us he brewed up a new American IPA before he left us in the cold! _Mount Carleton Grapefruit IPA_ was named after the highest summit in the Maritimes, and was fittingly hopped entirely with the **Summit** variety, bringing "citrus aromas of orange, tangerine, and grapefruit". The beer also features the addition of freshly-zested grapefruit peel, to boost that characteristic even more. Coming in at 6.5% ABV and 60 IBUs, it's available at select HR accounts now.

• Fredericton's [Graystone](http://graystonebrewing.com/) has a new beer on tap to join their 10+ offerings brewed in-house - _Lost Pale_ is being described as an American Pale Ale that is "light, easy-drinking, with some spicy notes", thanks to the addition of Czech **Saaz** hops. Also hopped with **Fuggles** (no American varieties were used in this beer), it comes in 4.9% ABV and 50 IBUs; you can grab it on tap now at the brewery, and likely find it at a few establishments in the city.

• Since we spotted a [tease](https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ3lklyB4zv/) about trial batches on their Instagram a month or so ago, we’ve been doing our best to get [Lazy Bear Brewing](http://www.lazybearbrewing.ca/) to tell us about their latest brew. The time has finally come to give you the goods on _Folly_, a wild IPA expected to be available this coming week. Using a yeast from South Carolina wild yeast purveyors [SouthYeast Labs](http://www.southyeast.com/), who also provided a different yeast strain for the _Carolina Saison_ a few weeks back, this brew comes in at 6.2% ABV and a solid 54 IBU. The yeast provides some fruity characteristics, although more muted that those in the Carolina, and features Ontario-grown **Perle** and **Wild Turkey** in a generous dry-hop along with **Nelson Sauvin**. It’s got a fruity aroma, with elements of peaches, mangoes and berries complementing citrus notes from the hops. It’s hazy and deliciously fruity with a clean, refreshing finish. Look for the official announcement sometime next week on the brewery’s [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lazybearbrewing/) and/or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lazybearbrewing/) pages. We’re told some kegs of this one _might_ make their way to the city, but the only sure way to try it is to head down to the brewery and get it from the source! Brewmaster Erin also tells us they’ve got a third brew using a SouthYeast strain on the go right now, so look for news on that one in the coming weeks.

• In cider news this week, [Annapolis Cider Company](http://drinkannapolis.ca/) released the latest offering in their Something Different series yesterday. _Toasted Oak & Maple_ began with their signature dry and cool-fermented cider that was then aged on French Oak and balanced with freshly-pressed juice from the **Golden Russet** and **McIntosh** varieties. A touch of Annapolis Valley-sourced maple syrup provided the finish, yielding a 7.9% ABV sparkling cider with notes of toasted oak, caramel and vanilla contrasting with tart apples and a hint of sweet maple on the finish. As always with the Something Different ciders, $0.50 from each refill will support a local cause, in this case the local [Acadia University Chapter](https://www.facebook.com/acadiaglobalmeddentphbrigades/) of [Global Brigades](https://www.globalbrigades.org/), a student-led mobile health and dental initiative that provides annual clinics in Honduras.

• Making their debut at this month's Fredericton Craft Beer Fest was the [Moncton Craft Brewers Collective](https://www.facebook.com/Moncton-Craft-Brewers-Collective-326374931097523/?ref=br_rs). The group of breweries and ciderhouses in southern New Brunswick is comprised of [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301), [Beckwith Road](http://beckwithroad.com/), [Bore City](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/), [Celtic Knot](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing), [Flying Boats](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710), [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/), [Scow Cider](http://vergerbelliveauorchard.ca/products/scow-craft-cider/) by Belliveau Orchard, and [Tide & Boar Brewing](http://www.tideandboar.com/). Their mission is to bring together the local craft brewing community, to support each other and elevate the support of local products. Look for them, and their members at next month's [Saint John Beerfest](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest) (April 8th) and [Atlantic Beer Festival](https://www.facebook.com/atlanticbeerfest/) (May 27 & 28th). The Tide & Boar Gastropub will be the site of the MCBC's Tap Takeover on **April 22nd**, featuring beer and cider from their members flowing all day.

• Great news for local beer fans on the South Shore of Nova Scotia! Currently located just outside of Bridgewater, [FirkinStein Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/FirkinStein-Brewing/754150891380564) has announced that they will be opening a satellite location on Bridgewater's King Street. Aiming for a June opening, the second location will feature a 300 litre pilot system for more fun and experimental small batch brewing, *and* a storefront where folks can purchase bottles and growlers of their beer, and sit for a spell enjoying their selections on tap. We'll keep you up-to-date with their progress as they aim for a late-spring opening.

• [Propeller Brewing Company](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) is hosting [Brew Patriot Love](https://www.brewpatriotlove.ca/), a Canada-wide toast on July 1st. They are encouraging breweries, and homebrewers, to brew up their take on a "quintessential Canadian lager", and come together on Canada's 150th birthday to release and share a bottle, can, pint, or glass (or all of the above). For those who want to partake, they are also holding the [Great Canadian Lager Challenge](https://www.brewpatriotlove.ca/read-me/), **July 14-15**, where a team of celebrity judges will choose the most Patriotic Beer and those beers with the best use of local and iconic ingredients. Check it out and sign up today!

• Planning and event details are trickling in for May's [Nova Scotia Craft Beer Week](http://nscraftbeer.ca/craftbeerweek/), May 5-14, and we can share that for the first time this year, the CBANS is releasing a special beer to celebrate. _Collaboration Ale_ is an ode to the province's roots, with an 80/- (Eighty Shilling) Scottish Ale being chosen to represent the more than thirty brewers who are [members of CBANS](http://nscraftbeer.ca/members/). Brewed at [Nine Locks](http://www.ninelocksbrewing.ca), but with input from many members, the beer is a deep amber colour with caramel sweetness, weighing in at 4.7% ABV and 15 IBUs, and features malt from the province's very own [Horton Ridge Malt & Grain](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/). The beer is pre-launching next Friday,** March 31st**, at [Good Robot Brewing](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) from noon. Drop by to get the first tastes of the beer before its full release, learn more about the full events list for NSCBW, and talk shop with brewers from across the province.

• Charlottetown's [HopYard](http://hopyard.ca/) has really been nailing it with tap takeovers lately, and they've got [another winner](https://www.facebook.com/events/196111350879342/) coming up soon!

**A few more beers have been released, or coming soon, this week:**

- Good Robot is bringing back their _Extra BIG-ASS Beer_, their spin on a Marzen/Oktoberfest lager, with an amber colour, and light bitterness, from **Perle** and **Willamette** hops and fermented with an Oktoberfest lager yeast.

- [Grimross](http://grimross.com/) has added another beer to their canned lineup, _Maritime Cream Ale_ (5% ABV), which joins their _Maritime Pale Ale_ and recently-canned _Pugnacious Porter_.
- [Loyalist City](https://loyalistcitybrewing.ca)'s flagship _Lupulus Interruptus_ IPA is back, with a slightly-tweaked recipe with even more hops (**Cascade**, **Citra** and **Simcoe**) than before! Look for it at your favourite LC accounts.
