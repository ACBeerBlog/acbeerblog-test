Pump House Brewery has two new products and a variety pack available now on ANBL shelves in New Brunswick (as of this writing only in Moncton and Dieppe).  The same products are also available broadly in Nova Scotia on NSLC shelves.

Thai Wheat is available in 6 packs and [is described on the Pump House website as](http://restaurant.pumphousebrewery.ca/our-beer/seasonal-brews):


<blockquote>A blonde thirst-quenching wheat beer with the aromatic bouquet and flavours of spices, lemongrass and ginger. Lightly acidic and tart with a very clean finish. Pair it up with your favorite seafood dish or some spicy wings! 5.0 - 5.5% ABV</blockquote>


Oktoberfest is available in 6 packs as well and is described as:


<blockquote>Reflective of the season Oktoberfest has a rich amber hue, medium body and malty bouquet. Blending together 4 roasts of barley to create a delicious harmony of sweet flavours including caramel and toffee. The elegant bitterness imparted by the German Noble hops keeps it perfectly balanced and provides a wonderful transition from the lighter beers of summer to the winter's heartier brews. Prosit! 5.5% ABV.</blockquote>


When [I met with Shaun Fraser earlier this year](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/14/the-story-of-pump-house-brewery-moncton-n-b/), he mentioned that he was planning on rotating some seasonal beers in bottles or cans so I'm guessing the Oktoberfest, if not both, are seasonal offerings.  (_Updated Oct 9th:  I can confirm that both the Oktoberfest and the Thai Wheat are available in generic seasonal 6 pack packages._)

Twelve pack sample variety packs are now available as well.  Neither the NSLC or ANBL sites specify which beers are available but I'm going to guess it is two each of the [original six bottled beers](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/beer):  Cadian Cream Ale, Fire Chief's Red Ale, Scotch Ale, Blueberry Ale, S.O.B. and Premium Lager.  (_Updated Oct 9th:  Call me Nostradameus, the variety pack comes with two each of the identified beers_.)

I'll update the post when I can confirm or correct the above assumptions.
