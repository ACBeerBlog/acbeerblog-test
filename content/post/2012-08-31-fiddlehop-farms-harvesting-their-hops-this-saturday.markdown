Today I received the following press release from FiddleHop Farms regarding this weekend's annual hop harvest:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

[FiddleHop Farms](http://www.fiddlehop.ca/) will complete their second year in production with their annual hops harvest this Saturday!

Glenholme, NS – September 1, 2012 – This Saturday, Nova Scotia’s largest hop yard, FiddleHop Farms will be capping off another season in production. With the help of some amazing volunteers the FiddleHop crew will be harvesting this year’s yield of local organic hops for Halifax beer maker, Garrison Brewery.

“We’re really excited to continue our partnership with Garrison Brewery” said Evan Price, co-owner of FiddleHop Farms. “We were very pleased with the ‘3 Fields Harvest Ale’ which was made in collaboration with hops from our field and 3 other hops producers in the province. We have an exceptional yield of crops this year and we are proud that our hops and farm will be a part of such a great product!”

“It has been a full season of overcoming obstacles, while using organic pest control and nutrient management techniques” co-owner Jason Pelley added.  “We’re very proud to be a part of Nova Scotia’s farming community and contribute to a completely Nova Scotian beer.”

FiddleHop Farm works very closely with Garrison ‘Brewmaster’, Daniel Girard to ensure quality production for brewing. Each year all the hop farms in Nova Scotia who supply Garrison, harvest their crop on the same day and Garrison adds them to the kettle within a 24 hour period to create this special annual “wet hop” brew.

Be sure to watch for the release of Garrison Brewery’s “3 Fields Harvest Ale” this season! Made with over 100kg of Nova Scotia "wet hops” this ale is a great celebration of the local beer making industry!

About Fiddle Hop Farms
Fiddle Hop Farms was established in early February 2010. Evan Price had been running a fresh fiddlehead distribution business that harvested wild fiddleheads for sale in May and June. To better organize the harvest, the fiddlehead crew transplanted some 12,000 crowns onto the farm property in Glenholme over six weeks. The farm has about three acres of wild fiddleheads which produce about 5,000 lbs of the fresh veggies each year.
