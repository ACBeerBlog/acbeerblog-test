[![NS CBW 2016 splash](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/NS-CBW-2016-splash-1024x575.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/NS-CBW-2016-splash.jpg)

The 2016 NS Craft Beer Week starts this Friday. A presentation of the [Craft Brewers Association of Nova Scotia](http://nscraftbeer.ca/craftbeerweek/), the aim of the week is to showcase the innovative products of its members, and collaborations with bars, restaurants and licensees. With so many different events to keep track of, we thought it would be beneficial to have them all in one place. Scroll all the way to the bottom for a handy calendar and map.

But first, with all of these events going on over the coming days, we can expect to see several new beers (and some returning favourites) from many of the participating breweries. Here's a taste of what will be joining the many regular-release beers that will be pouring all week...

[Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/), [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) & [Tatamagouche...](http://tatabrew.com/)

These three breweries came back together for an organic conspiracy of epic proportions.... _Cerberus _American IPA. This Certified Organic beer weighs in at 7% ABV, and features massive additions of **Ahtanum, ****Amarillo**, **Centennial, Chinook, Citra, ****Simcoe** and **Zythos** hops for an assertive, but not offensive, aroma and flavour. After a sneak peek at Propeller's Prop'r Cask Night last week, it will be available around the province beginning Friday, including the two Signature events kicking off the week, as well as on tap for growler fills at each of the conspiring breweries. There will also be a limited number of bottles available at Big Spruce and Tatamagouche.

"South" and "North" Collaboration Grogs

There will be two new "Grogs" at the Race the Kegs event on Sunday, May 8th at the Gahan House Harbourfront. Both are collaboration beers - one from the "South" team (Boxing Rock, Garrison, Hell Bay, Propeller, and Schoolhouse), and one from the "North" (Big Spruce, Good Robot, North, and Uncle Leo’s). Details are under wraps on each of these beers for now; you'll have to attend the event that afternoon to find out for yourself!

We've heard rumours of more than a dozen other new beers being launched this week from all over the province, but many of the breweries are keeping mum about the details until after the Stillwell Open or Stubborn Goat Royal Rumble. Keep your eyes open for the 2016 launch of Big Spruce's _Silver Tart_, Boxing Rock's brand new _Where There's Smoke_, Meander River's returning _Surf & Turf_ Strong Scotch Ale, Rudders' brand new _Sweet Georgia Brown_ Double Chocolate Oatmeal Stout, a whole gamut of _Seventh Wave_ beers from Spindift, the return of Tata's _Deadeye_ DIPA, and many more.
