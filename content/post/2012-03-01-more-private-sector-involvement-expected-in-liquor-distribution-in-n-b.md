As per an article on the [CBC website](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/02/29/nb-nbliquor-private-future-130.html?cmp=rss), proposed reforms to NB Liquor will give the private sector a large role in province wide liquor distribution in a report created for the Provincial Government.   The report does not call for total privatization but has two broad recommendations.  The two recommendations are for NB Liquor to examine its existing operations as well as explore opportunities with third-party groups including potentially strategic alliances with other regional liquor boards.

Other recommendations listed in the report include setting up liquidation stores in areas close to the Quebec and United States borders which generally offer far lower prices for their products.  The possibility of more specialty stores such as beer stores was mentioned as a possibility as well.
