[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/beerfest-index-link.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/beerfest-index-link.jpg)I had the chance to attend my (shamed to admit) first Seaport BeerFest yesterday afternoon.  Other than less than ideal weather (it drizzled most of the afternoon) it was an excellent time.  Even if it had been a torrential rain or snow storm, as long as there is a great variety of beer, and their was, it's impossible not to have a blast at a beer festival. I also had the chance to put a face to some names I've followed on Twitter and have a quick chat with Stephen Beaumont.  Overall an excellent time.

In terms of the beers I sampled, for the most part I stayed away from beers I have tried before with a few exceptions.  Due to the rain I didn't take detailed notes but here's my list of favourite beers from the festival:  Saint Bock Mal√©diction Stout, Rockbottom Fathom IPA and Jackstar Stout (I have had these 2 before), Garrison's Comet Double IPA and Hell Bay Smoked Rye Ale.  My only disappointment was that some of the beers I really wanted to try were not available (Brew Dog beers and Vache Folle Imperial Milk Stout).  Hopefully they'll have more on hand next year.  Other than that everything was fantastic and I'm already looking forward to the 2013 Halifax Seaport BeerFest!
