[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/rock_bottom3.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/rock_bottom3.jpg)Rockbottom Brewpub will be releasing its Day of Wreckoning **I**mperial **S**tout Thursday, March 8th at 5pm.Â  The brew is described as


<blockquote>a big luscious brew aged on oak then aged some more allowing the flavours to mature. It screams Bourbon and Port notes then quickly settles into an amazing complexity of flavour, layer after layer. Fruit, vanilla, oak, cherries, caramel and chocolate to start with superb tannin balance. Served nitrogenated through a sparkler faucet.</blockquote>
