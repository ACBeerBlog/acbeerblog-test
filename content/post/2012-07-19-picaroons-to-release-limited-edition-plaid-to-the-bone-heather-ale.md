As mentioned on [Picaroons Pub website](http://www.picaroonspub.com/profiles/blogs/plaid-to-the-bone-heather-ale) and [Canadian Beer News](http://www.canadianbeernews.com/2012/07/18/picaroons-releases-plaid-to-the-bone-heather-ale-for-highland-games/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CanadianBeerNews+%28Canadian+Beer+News%29), Picaroons will be releasing a special edition "Plaid to the Bone" Heather Ale.  The brew was created specifically for the upcoming [New Brunswick Highland Games Festival](http://www.highlandgames.ca/hg/news.html) and the name was chosen as a result of a contest won by Emily Moller.

The brew was made with real Heather tips and flowers and will be launched in Cask form at the Lunar Rogue Tuesday, July 24th.  The beer will also be available throughout the week at the [Brewtique](http://www.picaroonspub.com/profiles/blogs/brewtique-tap-listing-1) and at the festival itself.
