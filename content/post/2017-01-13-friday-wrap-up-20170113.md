Welcome to the weekend, and another warm Friday! Unfortunately, that looks like it's going to change quickly and drastically (which seems to be a common trend this winter), so grab a beer and a blanket for later (or now), and get ready for another long read, as there's lots going on in beer news in our region this week...

• We start today's post in Newfoundland, where [Port Rexton Brewing](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) has released _The One with the Citra_, an American Pale Ale, hopped with, not surprisingly, **Citra** (with some assistance from **Centennial,** too). The resulting 5.2% ABV and 45 IBU beer shows plenty of citrus and tropical fruit goodness. Look for it on tap at PR's familiar tap accounts shortly, including [Adelaide Oyster House](http://www.theadelaideoyster.ca), [EVOO](http://evoorestaurant.ca), [The Fifth Ticket](http://www.thefifthticket.com), [Mallard Cottage](http://www.mallardcottage.ca), and [Merchant Tavern](http://themerchanttavern.ca) in  St John's, and [White Hills Ski Resort](http://whitehillsresort.com) in Clarenville.

• Let's stick to The Rock for the next beer, another debut from [Mill Street's St. John's](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) location. _Danimal S.M.A.S.H._ is a 6.4% ABV, 63 IBU, Pale Ale, with plenty of character from its Single Malt And Single Hop choice, namely **Wild Turkey** hops from [Clear Valley Hop Farm](http://www.clearvalleyhops.com/) in Nottawa, Ontario. This unique hop is only available from Clear Valley, as it began life growing wild on their farm, and tested very high in Alpha Acid (useful in the bittering) and is quite aromatic (notes of mango and passionfruit), making it a great dual-purpose crop. Learn more about the hop [here](http://www.clearvalleyhops.com/wild-turkey), and pick up a pint or growler of the beer at Mill Street's Harbour Drive location.

• The latest [902 BrewCast](http://www.902brewcast.com/) went live earlier this week, and the gents sat down with Andy, Chris, and Laura from [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/). Be sure to give it a listen to learn more about their beginnings, the first three years in business, and what special beers are headed their way to Barrington soon! Case in point, be sure to head to Stilly **tomorrow** for Part 2 of the [Mikkeller Tap Takeover](https://www.instagram.com/p/BO-VQimALwg/), featuring a dozen taps from the [Danish gypsy brewery](http://mikkeller.dk/), plus Copenhagen-inspired snacks. It will be a great showcase of the brewery's offerings, with a selection of their flavoured Berliner Weisses, Spontan-family, big IPAs, and massive stouts. Back to the podcast, our own acbbchris sat down with the 902 Brew Dudes for an IPA tasting, which will be released January 20th. And learn more about the gents behind the podcast in the latest [The Coast](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/bottoms-up-with-halifaxs-craft-beer-podcast/Content?oid=5919644) weekly newspaper.

• Digby's [Roof Hound Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/roofhound/) has released a pair of beers recently, both in the IPA category. _Sweet Little SIPA_ is a 4.8% Session IPA, a style known for pale colour, light body, and low ABV, but still brimming with hop flavour and aroma. This recipe features lots of **Cascade** and **Columbus**, for citrus and floral notes. The bigger brother of the _SIPA_ is the _Big Stink IPA_, a 6.4% IPA with **Columbus** and **Mosaic** hops, added throughout the brewing process for a medium bitterness and plenty of citrus and fruit character. Both beers are available at the brewery now, and can be found on tap in HRM at your favourite beer bar.

• And keep your eyes peeled for a new collaboration beer brewed at Roof Hound with [Tatamagouche's](http://tatabrew.com/) Matt Kenny. A currently-unnamed 9.4% ABV Imperial Chocolate Porter will be released **February 11th**, complete with launch party and live music from [Tide n Timbre](https://www.facebook.com/people/Tide-N-Timbre/100012330700180). More details on the event and beer in a few weeks.

• Making its debut last night at last night’s Craft Beer and Local Food Celebration - alongside a Hop Fritter from [Primal Kitchen](http://www.primalhfx.ca/) in which it was featured - was a collaboration IPA from [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) and the [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague/) . _Mrs. Magouche_ is a 7.7% ABV brew with 75 IBU worth of bitterness and layers of flavors from dank and juicy **Simcoe**, **El Dorado**, and **Amarillo** hops. This one is quite tropical, with notes of stone fruit and peach owing to both the hops and the choice of Escarpment Labs’ Vermont Ale yeast (a.k.a., the “Conan” strain made famous by the [Alchemist](https://alchemistbeer.com/) brewery in Vermont). Tap accounts will be receiving kegs today, with some availability for growler fills from the source and the remainder being put into cans next week.​

• Also in the works from Tata are the _Oyster Cloister_, featuring lots of Malagash-grown oysters and the _Deadeye DIPA_, which was brewed this time on that same Vermont Ale yeast strain as the Mrs. Magouche. Look for more information on these as their releases approach later in the month or into February. They’re also planning a couple of winter bottle releases, namely a Glenora Barrel-aged Barleywine on the 26th of this month and a Belgian Quad (also known as a Belgian Strong Ale) on February 9th. We’ll confirm these dates as the releases approach, and provide more detail on the beers themselves.

• Last night's event was also the debut of [Spindrift'](http://spindriftbrewing.com/)s new _Duplicitous_ Imperial Pilsner; [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) doubled the love with two new beers, _Risky Biscuits_ Dark Mild and _Liquid James Brown_, a Milkshake IPA. Check out [last week's post](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/01/06/friday-wrap-up-20170106/) for more details on these beers, and they will all be available at your favourite bar or growler filling station starting today!

• Also attending the Celebration was [Sober Island](http://www.soberislandbrewing.ca/), pouring their new _British IPA_. This 6.3% ABV beer features a blend of four hops: **Bramling Cross**, **Cluster**, **East Kent Golding**, and **Willamette**. They come together to give 40 IBU of bitterness, and notes of woodiness, earthiness, and light fruit, to balance the nice malt body from the grain. The _British IPA_ joins the core line-up, along with the _Oyster Stout_, _Golden Rye_, and _Bitter_.

• Sober Island is also releasing a new beer in a couple of weeks, a _Winter Rye_. This 6.8% ABV beer features a hearty 15% rye in the malt bill, joining Marris Otter, Munich, and Crystal malts, for a spicy kick on a big body and mouthfeel. Hops-wise, **Northern Brewer** and **Tettnang** come together for 30 IBU to offset some sweetness and enhance the rye spice character. This beer will be launched during a collaborative Tap Takeover at Bishop's Cellar **January 28th**, joined by Dartmouth's [Brightwood Brewery](http://brightwoodbrewery.com). Folks from both breweries will be in store 1-3pm to chat beer, their breweries, whatever you'd like! Installation and commission of their big brewing system at [Henley House](https://www.facebook.com/TheHenleyHouse/) in Sheet Harbour is coming along nicely, and they expect to be brewing on a larger scale in the next 6-8 weeks, with lots of great news coming in Spring.

• There's three new beers out from Fredericton's [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) since last Friday's post, and two of these brews have also been released in cans. First up is _Ellipse _(6.5% ABV, ~50 IBUs), a new IPA featuring heavy additions of **Amarillo**, **Citra** and **Chinook**. As with most of TW's hoppy beers, this one is light-coloured, very hazy, and extremely juicy! Available only in growlers and pints, it's hitting all [ANBL growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) locations this weekend, so you don't have to come directly to Fredericton to get it!

• Moving on, TW released _Mo-Joe_, an Imperial Milk Stout (6.3% ABV) earlier this week in both growlers and 16 oz cans. Aside from the addition of lactose powder to slightly increase the sweetness and body of the beer, a special blend of coffee was also added in secondary, in the form of beans. These beans are the new "TrailWay Blend", from the local [Whitney Coffee Company](http://www.whitneycoffee.com/), designed to be "particularly fruity and full of character" (1-lb bags of the beans are available for purchase at the brewery). According to TW, Mo-Joe is "chocolate-forward in flavour", and is the perfect beer to balance the coffee character from the beans.

• Finally, TW is about to release their latest sour beer, _Cerasus_. While kettle-soured with Lactobacillus, like their first attempt, _Sour 1_, _Cerasus_ was hopped only minimally, and was refermented on a "huge amount" of cherries. This "cherry sour" is supremely-sessionable at just 3.6% ABV, with a bright-red colour, and lots of cherry in the aroma and flavour, along with the expected tartness/sourness from the work of the _Lactobacillus_. Available in 16 oz cans at the brewery tomorrow, along with a small amount that was kegged for growler fills at the same location.

• It's easy to forget on mild days like today that we're still in the dead of winter, but there's been no shortage of well-below-zero temperatures. Luckily, [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has brewed up a beer with the aim of helping ease our pain - _Wintervention_, an Imperial Chocolate Stout. This is a big beer, brewed with lots of Maritime Pale Ale, Chocolate and Munich malt, resulting in a 10.5% ABV beer... making it extremely warming! Hopped exclusively with **Millennium** to 60 IBUs, the beer was conditioned for a month on cocoa nibs, giving "rich, bittersweet chocolate aromatics, with dark dried fruits and vanilla underneath", according to the brewery. It's available in 650 mL bottles at the brewery and private liquor stores in the HRM starting today. And for those of you who are keen on barrel-aged beers (and who isn't?), they are currently aging some _Wintervention_ in barrels from Buffalo Trace Distillery, but you'll have to wait a while for that release.

• Celebrating their 20th Anniversary this year, [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) is looking to spice things up a bit. Their Gottingen location will be undergoing some renovations and upkeep during the next two months, which means events and brewery tours will not be available. Fear not, however, as the Prop Shop will still be open for all of your growler, cans, and bottle needs. During their twentieth, keep an eye out for plenty of special One-Hit-Wonders (like their _Vanilla Porter_, pouring now), a light branding refresh, plenty of parties, and a whole lotta fun!

• Today sees the return of the v3.0 variant of a [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) signature, the _Burban Legend_ APA. This one, with a big **Citra** dry-hop, is a favourite of Good Robot Josh, who loves the interplay of the layers of fruit from the hops with the malty sweet body. And on Sunday a small batch off the Sabco BrewEasy will be available at the taproom, a BetaBrew from GR’s own Kelly and Erica who call it an ode to their pre-teen red-headed fem inspiration (Ginger Spice) and their ancestral heritage. _Scottish Spice Ginger Ale_ leverages Scottish Ale yeast to enhance a solid malt body that features a touch of rye spiciness and some biscuity notes from Victory malt. **Perle** and **Chinook** hops provide the balance along with organic ginger root for additional spice and locally-harvested sumac for a hint of lemony citrus. At 4% ABV and 29 IBU this beer shouldn’t overwhelm, but it may titillate; you’ll have to decide for yourself this weekend.

• [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/)'s first DIPA, _8 Cord_ (8.5% ABV, 70 IBUs), is returning in both growler and can form, officially re-releasing at the brewery next Thursday, January 19th. Brewed with 2-row and Wheat malt, it's hopped with plenty of **Azacca**, **Mosaic**, and **Simcoe** - all hop varieties that are hard to find, but for a good reason, as they impart lots of juicy, tropical fruit characteristics when used. Most of the 16 oz cans will actually be shipping to New Brunswick (where it should be available sometime after the 23rd); there will also be a small amount of kegs going to select locations in both NB and NS. And in other PEIBC DIPA news, be sure to visit your local ANBL growler station this weekend, as all will be carrying the brewery's new _Mango Lassi_ DIPA that we reported on [last Friday](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/01/06/friday-wrap-up-20170106/).

• With the 5th Annual [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) and its week of events is fast approaching (March 8th-12th), they have just announced the launch of the [Down East Brewing Awards](https://www.facebook.com/events/398717783803804/). All licensed breweries in the Maritimes are invited to submit their beers for entry; many awards will be presented at FCBF, including 10 beer awards, one each for cider and mead, and Brewery of the Year and New Brewery of the Year awards. Judging will take place on February 28th among a panel of certified judges, brewers and industry professionals. The winning entries will be showcased at FCBF, where they will be enjoyed by the more than 1700 attending. The details are still being ironed out, so we'll be sure to keep you updated over the coming weeks.

• [Gahan Harbourfront Halifax](http://halifax.gahan.ca/) is holding their very first Homebrewer's Challenge, and the entry period starts today! Open to all amateur homebrewers in the province, they are looking for your best Trappist Single (BJCP Style 26A). You must pre-register by emailing Gahan Brewmaster [Kyle Jeppesen](mailto:kyle.jeppesen@murphyrestaurants.ca) before Feb 17, and your four bottles are due **March 10th**. The winner will get to brew with Jeppesen and have their beer served at Gahan, and will win a dinner and a few beers for their hard work and accomplishment. Check out the [information poster](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPNZstMBk54) for a few more details. Good luck to all entrants!

• And speaking of brewing awards, the [2017 Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) registration opens on Monday. From then until March 10th, breweries can register their beers for judging, with sample delivery to be scheduled March 13-24th. More details on how to enter are [here](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/how-to-enter/), and the Style Guidelines are [available online now](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/style-guidelines-beer/). Let's hope for another strong showing from Atlantic Canadian breweries in 2017!

We've got a few events that we'd like to highlight this week:

• **Right now**, Friday morning, the gang at Moncton's Tide & Boar has set up their [Growler Pop-Up Shop](https://www.facebook.com/events/1812224055683130/), with a pair of beers available: _Galaxy Double Dry-Hopped Forum Pale Ale_ and _Sour Otis Fruit Cake_ (A Kettle Sour brewed with 20lbs of assorted dried fruit). As with their last go of it in December, we suggested getting there early, as these beers are sure to sell out.

• The gang at Good Robot has a busy week ahead, starting with one of their extremely popular [Silent Reading](https://www.facebook.com/events/606867809522253/) nights on **Tuesday**, and continuing with some ticketed events that are part of the In the Dead of Winter Festival: the [Pre-Festival Party](https://www.facebook.com/events/1798277697101245/) on **Wednesday**, and song circles on [Thursday](https://www.facebook.com/events/589436191250549/) and [Friday](https://www.facebook.com/events/1822841501291182/).​

• [Upstreet Brewing](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) is re-releasing their _Top Stamp_ Honey Brown Lager, and is holding a talent show (of sorts!) to celebrate. On **Thursday, January 19th** from 6-10 pm at the brewery, the [Top Stamp Gong Show](https://www.facebook.com/events/237936373299813/) will highlight the "talents" of Islanders, by inviting all those interested to perform their talent on stage, in front of a packed house. There will be two official judges - if they like what you've got, you'll move on to the finals, and if not... you'll be gonged off stage. No pressure! The event is free to attend; if you are interested in performing, you can fill out the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4mOlHbZkpV8lEeafW_D56wn4fARNK0yYhtZJmyJcD5MR4sw/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=send_form).

• New Brunswick has recently been privy to some beers from [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) (finally!), but **Saturday, January 21st** will see a true Tata-celebration at [Ducky's](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar) in Sackville, with a Tatabrew tap takeover! Starting at 7 pm, there will be a grand total of 15-20 Tata beers pouring, ranging anywhere from flagship beers, to seasonals, to special one-offs. Tatabrew's own Christiane Jost and Matt Kenny will be on-hand to chat about the brewery and their beers, and probably just about anything else! Tickets ($15 each) will be available in advance, and will allow you seven 5 oz drink tickets, including a commemorative glass to keep (you can also pay at the door, but you will be limited to five drink tickets); a portion of ticket sales will go to [Enactus MtA](https://www.mta.ca/Community/News/2016/February/Enactus,_Leadership_Mount_Allison_pairing_up_on_community_projects/), out of Mount Allison University. Further 5 oz pours will also be available at a discount price. Contact the bar directly to reserve your tix, which can be picked up before the event at 6:30 pm.

• On **Wednesday, January 25th**, Liverpool's [Hell Bay](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) will be celebrating Robbie Burns Day in style. [Burns Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/657506147754405/) will be held at the brewery, and will feature poetry, haggie, bagpipes, and - of course - plenty of beer. If you're going to celebrate the life of Scotland's most famous poet and lyricist, you might as well show up in a kilt! Those that do will receive discounts on pints, so you'll have that going for you, too. The brewery will be open at 10 am, with the haggis being served at 6 pm.

• The next [Burgers n' Beer](https://www.facebook.com/events/398717783803804) event in Fredericton has been announced, and will take place on **Saturday, February 11th** at the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/). As always, your [ticket](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/frostival-burgers-n-beer-tickets-31045933222?aff=efbevent) ($25) will include four different hand-crafted sliders, paired with four different local craft brews (5 oz pours). The event is held from 1:30-3:30 pm, and will also announce details on this year's YFC Burger Battle (running from March 25th-April 8th).

A few more things before we sign off:

- Mahone Bay's [Saltbox Brewing](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) has new beer available for pints and growlers, _Jeezus Murphy_ Irish Red. A malt-forward 4.8% ABV brew, it features some roasted notes and subtle fruit character from the hops.
- Dartmouth's [Nine Locks Brewing](http://www.ninelocksbrewing.ca) will be releasing _Fathom Double IPA_ shortly, an 8.0% ABV showcase for plenty of American-grown hops. We'll have more details when they're available.
- [Beau's Brewery](http://beaus.ca/), from Vankleek Hill, Ontario, is looking to expand their presence in Eastern Canada, and as such, are hiring a [Brand Ambassador](http://beaus.ca/career/halifax/) as a local representative.
