[Mirella Amato](http://beerology.ca/about-toronto-beer-expert-mirella-amato/), Canada's first female, and seventh overall [Cicerone](http://www.cicerone.org/) (beer sommerlier) will lead the beer tasting and discussion on food pairings and history of women and beer. She is one of only ten [National Level Beer Judge Certification Program](http://www.bjcp.org/index.php) judges in the country and has sat on the jury for multiple national and international beer events.Â  She is also a regular contributor to my [favourite magazine.](http://www.tapsmedia.ca/)

As per her [website](http://beerology.ca/about-toronto-beer-expert-mirella-amato/about-beerology/), the goal of her sessions is


<blockquote>

> 
> "not to make beer recommendations based on my taste, but rather to share the tools necessary for each participant to zero in on their own personal favourites. I aim to get people excited about beer and point them in the right direction so that they can confidently continue exploring on their own. I also like to provide the context for each beer, including historical tidbits as well as anecdotes on brands, breweries and styles."
