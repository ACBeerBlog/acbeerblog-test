The PEI Brewing Company will be hosting the first annual PEI International Beer Festival September 28th & 29th at the Charlottetown Festival Grounds.  Details are few at this point;  there is [a webpage for the event on PEI Brewing Company's website ](http://peibrewingcompany.com/beerfestival.html)with a [link to order tickets for the sessions on Friday and Saturday](https://peitickets.com/venue/pei-fall-flavours-festival/show/pei-international-beer-festival).  There is also similar information on the [PEI Brewing Company's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/peibrewingcompany).

This event is not to be confused with the [PEI Beer Festival](http://www.peibeerfestival.ca/about-the-pei-beerfest/) that will take place Thursday, September 6th and Friday, September 7th at the Delta Prince Edward in Charlottetown.
