[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/atlbeerfestival1.png)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/atlbeerfestival1.png)As per its official website, the Seventh Annual [Atlantic Beer Festival](http://www.atlanticbeerfestival.ca/Atlantic_Beer_Festival_New/Home.html) will take place at the Moncton Coliseum on May 26th.  The event has grown substantially over the years, starting as a small event at Global Festival Place in 2006 with 32 breweries and 78 beers.  The event moved to the Moncton Coliseum for 2007 and has remained there every year since.  In 2011 there was a total of 56 breweries featuring 130 different beers.

There will be two separate sessions to enjoy the beers, one from 2:30 to 5:00 and a night session from 7:30 to 10:00.  Tickets will go on sale in early April and will be available at the Coliseum Box Office, the Pump House Brewery, the Barn Yard BBQ and Greater Moncton Sobey's stores or online at [tickets.moncton.ca](http://tickets.moncton.ca/).  Ticket prices are not currently available on the website.   Free bus services will be available after each session (the bus ride is a definitely a fun part of the experience).

In 2011 Atlantic attendees included Picaroons, Garrison Brewing Company, Big Tide, Moosehead Breweries, Gahan House, and Pump House Brewery.  There was also a nice selection of Maine, Quebec, Alberta and Ontario craft breweries in addition to well know international beers.

I will post more information as it is available.
