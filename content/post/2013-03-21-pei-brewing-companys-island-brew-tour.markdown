The [PEI Brewing Company](http://www.peibrewingcompany.com) announced in February that it would be organizing a culinary tour of various restaurants and bars across the province. The tour pairs PEI Brewing Company beers with menu items at each location.

From the press release:

_"Fresh, local ingredients are staples of the Island culinary community and what better way to showcase that than with our partners combining their fantastic menu items with our award-winning beer products”, says Jeff Squires of the PEI Brewing Company. “We invite all Islanders to follow along and join us in our Island-wide tour. Good times with fantastic food and drink are sure to be had, as well as the chance to earn some PEI Brewing Company prizes along the way.”_

Al Douglas, the host of the event, says that the tour was started "as a way to show our support for the many restaurants, pubs, cafes, etc. that serve our product. Using social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), we promote the location by promoting food pairings with our beers, showcasing their menu and other general information about the restaurants."

The tour kicked off in Charlottetown in late February at [Ise's Bar](http://www.isesbar.com), followed by stops at [The Big Orange Lunchbox](http://www.bestplateforward.com), [The Landing](http://www.thelandingpei.com) in Tyne Valley, [Boston Pizza](http://www.bostonpizza.com), and last night's event at [Dundee Arms Inn](http://www.eden.travel/dundee). The tour continues tonight at [Sir Isaac's Pub](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sir-Isaacs-Restaurant-and-Mister-Gabes-Pub/161462415988), in Montague.

For the remainder of the month, the tour will have events at [The Albert and Crown](http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Albert-Crown-Pub-Eatery/171767569560120), in Alberton (March 22nd), [Brother's 2](http://www.brothers2.ca/), in Summerside (March 28th), and  [O'Shea's Pub](http://www.osheaspubandeatery.com/), in Kinkora (March 30th). The PEI Brewing Co's social media sites ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/peibrewingcompany), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/peibrewingcompany), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PEIBrew)) will have continuous updates for April and May; also, those on Twitter can follow specifically with the hashtag, #peibrewtour.
