Happy Summer, folks! It sure felt that the warm weather was never going to come, but with temperatures reaching well above 20C in all four provinces this week, we're finally able to dust off the patio furniture for real, and work on those farmer tans. Let's get right to the beer(s) you should be drinking!

• [Lunn's Mill Beer Company](https://lunnsmill.beer/) has added a new brew, _Anvil_, a Porter, to their list of offerings in Lawrencetown, NS. Described by the brewery as being closer to the American Porter style (as opposed to British), it's smooth and dark, with "hints of roast, chocolate, and dark fruit". With a moderate bitterness in the finish to balance the malt flavours, it weighs in at 5.8% ABV and 32 IBUs. It was released late last week at the brewery, so only limited amounts are likely still available. But fear not! They'll be brewing it again soon, and their tasting room has extended their hours (Thursdays 3:30-6:30 and Friday 12:00-6:00). And with three new 5 bbl (580 L) BIACs (Brew-in-a-Conical) arriving, there'll be a big increase in production at the brewery any day now!

• Halifax's [Chain Yard Urban Cidery](http://www.chainyardcider.com/) has released a brand new blend this week, _Yard Berry_. The base cider of Jonagold and Northern Spy apples was blended with NS High Bush blueberries that underwent an arrested fermentation (aka, stopped short of finishing too dry). The final product features notes of sour cherry, cranberry, and of course plenty of blueberry, with a heavier weight, but clean finish. Drop by their location at North & Agricola and enjoy a glass on their patio.

• [Western Newfoundland Brewing Company](http://westernnewfoundlandbrewing.ca/) has had a busy spring, brewing up some test batches at their Pasadena location. They currently have three of these smaller batches in rotation (as well as their _Killdevil_ Pale Ale and _Wild Cove_ Cream Ale) at their officially-unofficial taproom, [Galliott Studios](http://galliottstudios.blogspot.ca/) in Woody Point, located inside [Gros Morne National Park](http://pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/nl/grosmorne). On tap currently is _The Hoppin' McIlroy_, a Pale Ale brewed using wild hops from Norris Point, across Bonne Bay from the Studios. Also rotating through are _Oat Pale Ale_, featuring oats for a creamy mouthfeel and lots of late-hopping for a pleasant citrus and fruit flavour, and the preview for an upcoming wider release, _Stout River_ (formerly _Stout #1_). Take a drive into the Park, grab a pint and sit on their beautiful wharf, and watch the humpbacks and minke whales that frequent the Bay.

• Halifax’s [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/) is releasing an all-new beer today, the aggressively named _Sour M.F_. This is a wheat beer, kettle-soured and weighing in at 6.2% ABV. And here we depart from the typical text of an Unfiltered beer release because there’s no IBU number to report, nor are there any hop varieties to name. This ain’t a hoppy beer, it’s a sour, and in typical NASH style, it was rather unsubtly re-fermented on a metric fuckton of tart cherries for a big cherry bouquet. It’s described as acidic, refreshing and bright with a light spicy finish. Probably a beautiful beer for your patio drinking needs on a hot day. Available from noon today for fills at the brewery and pints next door at [Charm School Pub](https://twitter.com/charmschoolpub?lang=en).

• Those of us who’ve were lucky enough to share in the beers of **Peter Lionais** over his homebrewing career have reason to be excited, as there’s a new beer coming out of [Tidehouse](https://www.facebook.com/tidehousebrewingcompany/) and it finished at a specific gravity of 1.003. A beer that dry can mean only one thing: Peter’s been into the saison yeast again! Using a blend of two strains, _2 Many Birds_ is firmly in the saison style, with a balance of earthy and citrus characters from the yeast. A grist of largely Pilsner malt with some Vienna added for character yields a rounded mouthfeel despite the dry finish. Hops in this batch were a blend of the old school **Perle**, the American darling **Amarillo** and the Southern Hemisphere newcomer **Pacific Jade**, for a floral and orange-grapefruity hop presence. The lion’s share of this batch was shipped up to [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com)'s Beer Garden on Spring Garden, so look for it to appear there soon, with the balance likely to find a home across the water at [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) and for a severely limited number of fills at the retail space on Salter Street.

• Newfoundland's [Port Rexton Brewing](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) put their thinking caps on and developed a "100% Canadian beer", utilizing ingredients from all four of our favourite provinces. _Big Cod Mountain Ridge_ uses PEI malt (floor malted by Horton Ridge) in the grist, **Cascade** hops from [Moose Mountain Hops](http://www.moosemountainhops.com/) in NB, and pineapple weed (tea-infused) harvested in NL by [Cod Sounds](https://www.codsounds.ca/). Finally fermented by [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/)'s pin cherry-harvested yeast (with some help from [Escarpment Labs](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/)), the beer - probably best described as a Saison - comes in at 5% ABV and 19 IBUs and exhibits a "Belgian feel", and finishes very dry.

• [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) is releasing two beers today, one of which is new, the other, a returning favourite. The new brew is _Little Beast_, brewed for the [North End Runners](https://www.facebook.com/northendrunners/), a community of local runners who meet every Wednesday at 6 pm at North Brewing for a 6 km run. A 4% ABV "lagered ale", it was hopped with **Huell Melon** to 10 IBUs, and features an addition of salt to the boil. North wants you to think of it as a "post-run recovery beer"... sounds right to us! Returning is _White Lightning _(4.8% ABV), a dry-hopped kettle sour. This time around, the beer is slightly more tart, thanks to the use of a different Lactobacillus starter, and was hopped with **Azacca**, **Huell Melon**, and **Wai-Iti**. Both beers will be available as of today at both North locations, for growler and swing-top fills, as well as in 650 mL bottles.

• [TrailWay ](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/)has their brand new automatic canning line up and running, which means more cans for all of us, and less work for the TW crew! It also means new label designs, and packaging dates indicated on each can. _Beyond Reality_ (raspberry Fruit beer) is already out with its new look, and their Rye Pale Ale, _Rype_, will be available as of today. Finally, the winning American IPA in the first TrailWay Homebrew Challenge is available again (probably for the last time); _Hoppy McHazy_ was brewed by Pierre Gagnon, and features plenty of **Amarillo**, **Citra**, **Mosaic**, and **Simcoe**, for a huge blast of tropical, fruity goodness.

• And the circle of life is complete as we heard from a little birdie this week that the canning line Trailway replaced with their new whizzbang automatic dealio is on its way to [Sober Island](http://www.soberislandbrewing.ca/) on Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore. While we let you consider what that’s going to mean for **Rebecca Atkinson** and her crew, or, more to the point, for you, gentle beer drinker, we’ll tell you about their latest release, dubbed _Kirby’s Canoe_ Rye Pale Ale. The grist features 11% rye, which will almost certainly provide a spicy note on the finish. We also know that it was dry hopped with both **Willamette** and **Bramling Cross** hops, with the Bramling being the focus. This should provide a bright berry character. It’s straw-yellow in colour, with a solid 5.7% ABV and 30 IBU, if you really want to figure this one out, look for it in crowlers at the brewery, on tap at [The Henley House](https://www.facebook.com/TheHenleyHouse/) in Sheet Harbour and [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) in Dartmouth, and appearing at the [New Glasgow](https://ngfarmmarket.com/) and [Musquodoboit](http://www.mhfarmersmarket.ca/) Farmers Markets.

• Heading Southwest along Nova Scotia's coast, [FirkinStein](https://www.facebook.com/pages/FirkinStein-Brewing/754150891380564) in Bridgewater has their latest experiment on tap and ready for prime time. _Sassamanana_ is a 7.0% ABV Pale Ale, featuring the addition of cranberries and banana to the beer. While the techniques they used are secret (trust us, we asked!), they promise that the light tart character from the berries, and creaminess from the banana will make for a great experience. The beer is debuting at tomorrow morning's [Bridgewater Farmers' Market](https://bridgewaterfarmersmarket.ca/). And keep an eye out for the news of their King Street satellite brewery/taproom/retail location, which is poised to open before the end of the month.


• And back to the city, on the waterfront in Halifax, [Gahan Harbourfront](http://halifax.gahan.ca) is now serving up a batch of _Flavour of the Monk_ which was the winning beer in their first annual homebrew competition. Devised (and named) by **Ian Wheatley**, who you may remember from March’s Lil’Wheatey Tap Takeover at Tidehouse Brewing earlier this year, it’s a Belgian beer in the Trappist Single style, with a pillowy white head and moderate bitterness. The hops used are classic Czech and German noble varieities, giving a floral and spicy nose to balance against the classic peppery and fruity Belgian yeast character. It’s a fairly easy-drinking 5.4% ABV and 35 IBU. Meanwhile, Gahan has quietly become the second brewery in NS to offer crowlers. These 32oz cans let you take beer pretty much anywhere in a convenient package, or let you sock it in the fridge for up to a month. Only Gahan beers are available (no PEIBC or guest taps) and they’re available for $8 from the fridge at the restaurant entrance. Currently available in this format are their _Crosscurrent APA_, _Impatience Sour Brown_ and _Captain Falcon’s IPA_.


• [Maybee Brewing](http://www.maybeebrew.com/) is releasing _Old Growth_, an Extra Special Bitter, sometime today. The slightly-bigger brother to their _Slanty Shanty_ Best Bitter that originally came out last December, the malt and hop profiles have been tweaked slightly. [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) floor-malted Organic Pale Malt makes up the majority of the grist, with New Brunswick **Goldings** hops bringing the IBUs to 44. Exhibiting "hints of honey and caramel", and nicely-balanced with a firm bitterness, this 5.5% ABV beer is available at the brewery for pints, growlers, and cans. Look for cans to likely appear at select ANBL stores in the future; local tap accounts will also be receiving kegs.

• St. John's [YellowBelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) celebrated the changing of the seasons this week with the release of _Summer Solstice Crystal Wheat_. A nod to _Wexford Wheat_, one of their core beers, this beer features a simplified malt bill with just 2-Row and Wheat malts. Unlike _WW_, it is filtered, resulting in a bright, crystal-clear straw coloured beer. The hops are also unique to this release, with **Pacific Gem** and **Sorachi Ace** used in the boil, with more **Sorachi** and a second hop during dry-hopping. At 5.3% ABV and 18 IBUs, this is sure to be a crowd-pleaser on their patio this weekend at the corner of George Street, or to take-away when bottles make an appearance next week.

• Dropping today is YellowBelly's latest cider, this one is a blend of dry apple cider fermented with Champagne yeast and sweetened with a touch of unfermented cider, then blended with 6% cold-pressed cranberry juice from the Island's West Coast just prior to filtration. At 6.0% ABV, the resultant cider is juicy and tart, and thirst quenching for the warm weather (enjoy it over ice to extend the pleasure). On tap today, it should also see release in bottles at the Brewpub next week. And for a hint of what's to come this summer, YB is currently on the look-out for an experience manager for "YellowBelly Take-Away", to open at [264 Water Street](https://goo.gl/maps/e3sVFNk4BNU2) in the coming months. Contact them [via email](mailto:yellowbellygm@gmail.com) for more details.

• Nackawic's [Big Axe Brewery](http://www.bigaxe.ca/) has been busy crafting up some new sour beers, after the success of their kettle-soured _Partridgeberry Sour_ and _Sumac Sour_. Coming up next is their next entry, _Strawberry Sour_. Initially fermented with a "collection of Brettanomyces and bacteria", a neutral Ale strain (read: Saccharomyces) was used to finish things off. Real strawberries were then added during secondary fermentation, resulting in a "sourness complemented by a strawberry and citrus aroma" in this hazy, light-copper-coloured brew. Easy-drinking at 5% ABV, you'll be able to find this one on tap at the brewery, as well as in Fredericton at [540 Kitchen & Bar](https://www.facebook.com/540kitchenandbar) and the [Cider House](https://www.facebook.com/redroverbrew/). Next week should also see the release of _Seaberry Sour_, an amber-coloured kettle sour brewed with NB Sea Buckthorn berries, resulting in lots of citrus aromas, according to the brewery. This very-limited release will pop up at a few tap accounts.

• We have some great news for you New Brunswick Mead fans out there! Fredericton's [Sunset Heights Meadery](http://www.sunsetheightsmeadery.com/) has a very large shipment of bottles heading to more than 30 different ANBL locations across the province, starting this coming Monday, June 26th. After a few releases at four locations over the past months, the high demand was apparent; the current numbers hitting stores is ten times the amounts from before. Look for plenty of bottles of _Queen's Nectar_,_ Scuttlebutt_, _ChaChaChaga_, and _Latifah_ to be hitting shelves very soon, with another release scheduled for sometime in early September. You can check the ANBL location list [here](http://www.pollenangels.com/997-2).

• [Big Tide](http://www.bigtidebrew.com/) has announced that they have a beer coming out soon, _LaTour_, their entry in the Acadian Nut Brown style being seen more and more in New Brunswick (check out our mention of it in [last week's post](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/06/16/friday-wrap-up-20170616/) for more info). The 2 Row base malt is accented by plenty of CaraMunich and Chocolate Wheat malts for a medium-bodied, malt-forward, 6.5% ABV Nut Brown. Hopped to 27 IBUs with **Fuggles** for a mild bitterness and earthy aroma. A little past the June 9th official launch date, but that's ok! It'll be available at the brewpub for pours and growler next week. And grab a pint or growler of their 4.5% ABV _Zippy Pale Ale_, as it is sure to run out this weekend.


• Last week we told you a bunch of stuff about [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) that turned out to be a week too early (we blame contrails and the Illuminati). To save us some typing, you can catch up on that stuff right [here](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/06/16/friday-wrap-up-20170616/) (CTRL-F “robot” <enter>). We have it on good authority _this_ week, that you will finally see the _Cream Team_ cream ale appear this coming Tuesday, June 27th. This will mark the first of the Tuesday Beta Brew releases, heretofore and forever known as BetaBrewsDays. Also heading for Tuesday next, assuming kegs can be cleared in time, will be #2 in the SMaSH Pale Ale series, now officially known as _Hey Now_ (you're an all-star, get your game on, go play). And lastly, but not leastly, today will see the debut of the _Cherry Goseface Killah_, so head on down to Robie Street and get yourself some sour, salty brew with a fruit kick.


• [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) in Sydney, NS, has a brand new summer refresher out, the cleverly-named _Miami Weiss_, a weizen-style beer mixed with 100% organic grapefruit juice to create a Shandy. At a very light 4.0% and barely there 12 IBU it’s likely to be extremely crushable and perfect for a sunny afternoon on a patio somewhere. It’s already available at the brewery for pints and fills and you should see it make taps in the big city within the next couple of weeks. They’ve also got a third batch of the Stillwell Open-winning Seven Years Pale Ale just brewed and have put down their second lager for aging into early July. We’ll have more information on availability for the former and details on the latter in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, if you’re in Sydney this weekend and you love beer, why not swing by the brewery and check out Breton’s 2nd Birthday Party, which has been in full swing since kicking off last night. The festivities continue tonight with a [Music on Tap](https://www.facebook.com/events/427432410975870) event from 4 - 10 PM before tomorrow’s 10 hours of live music, food trucks and cake! Check out the [Breton Brewing Birthday Bash](https://www.facebook.com/events/1940606502850815) Facebook event page and plan accordingly!

• Down in the old [A. Keith’s Nova Scotia Brewery](http://keiths.ca/), a new beer is on the horizon, this one being labeled _Highland Scottish Pilsner_. Taking advantage of the similarities (water-chemistry wise) between the Halifax Pockwock water supply and the classic brewing liquor of Pilsen in the Czech Republic, this brew sees light and grainy Pilsner wed to the round sweet maltiness of Scottish Golden Promise. This will no doubt provide the beer with somewhat more body than a truly classic Pils, while preserving the dry and crisp finish characteristic of the style. The hopping also sees an uncommon marriage, with the classic **Saaz** combined with its descendant variety from New Zealand, **Motueka**. At 5.5% ABV and 20 IBU, you’ll find it available for growler fills at the brewery.

• Despite our best efforts, we're always finding out we're not quite as on top of things as we like to think we are. Case in point, this week we heard about The Groundswell Inn, located on the Fleur-de-lis trail in D'Escousse on Isle Madame, NS, on the south side of Cape Breton. A bed and breakfast with an attached British-style Pub, they've been since last year and feature 8 craft beer taps, one of the largest selections of craft beer, if not the largest, in Cape Breton! We've added them to the [Brewnosers Good Beer Map](http://acbeerblog.ca/the-brewnosers-atlantic-canada-good-beer-map/) on this site, but certainly if you're planning to be in the area or looking for accommodations or a place to have a pint near Isle Madame, check out [their website](http://www.thegroundswell.ca/) and look for info on their coming events on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thegroundswellinn) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/groundswellNS)!

• Those of us patiently waiting for [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/)'s _Silver Tart_ to be available in cans in Halifax, rejoice! After a run on the cans yesterday, we've been assured that there are a few hundred more being delivered to [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) this morning, in time for your post-work pint. Keep an eye on BC's [twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/BishopsCellar), as they'll be sure to announce their arrival. Or, why not make a run up to Nyanza, where you can also enjoy some food, live music, and relaxation courtesy of some Beer Yoga.

**Looking for a few things to do in the next few weeks? We've got lots to keep you busy, no matter where you are!**

• The tap takeovers at Charlottetown's [HopYard](http://hopyard.ca/) continue in full force **today, June 23rd**, with an [Upstreet/North Takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/390583231336638/) all day. All taps will be dedicated to the two breweries - check out the event link for a full list - including a new collaboration between the two, _Northern Light_, a 3.5% ABV, 15 IBUs Session IPA brewed with equal amounts 2-row and Wheat malt, and hopped with **Cashmere** and **Mosaic**. Launching at this event, _Northern Light_ will also be on tap at the Upstreet taproom in Charlottetown and [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) in Halifax, as well as select tap accounts in both cities.

• [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) is holding the [Grand Opening](https://www.facebook.com/events/1932474153693439/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A3%2C%22source_newsfeed_story_type%22%3A%22regular%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22[%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22newsfeed%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22feed_story%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A[]%7D]%22%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D&source=3&source_newsfeed_story_type=regular&action_history=[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22newsfeed%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22feed_story%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A[]%7D]&has_source=1&fref=nf) of their brewery and taproom **tomorrow, June 24th**, starting at 11 am. A selection of NS craft beer will be on tap for purchase, including - of course - several of the releases from Horton Ridge, which are only available at the brewery/malt house. Singer/songwriter [Caleb Miles](http://calebmiles.net/) will be performing at 6 pm, and the [Let's Eat Beer](https://www.facebook.com/letseatbeer/?fref=mentions) food truck will be serving up some beer-infused items all day (all proceeds will be going to Atlantic Canadian charities). Games, tours, and door prizes will be rounding out the day, so drop by and bring the family!

• Back to Upstreet, who will be having their 2nd Birthday next week, and like last year, will be celebrating with the launch of a new beer in their annual De Novo series. _De Novo II_ is a Belgian Saison brewed with Maritime malt, New Brunswick **Goldings** hops, and fermented with a Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces blend. The result is flavours of "light candy and funk", backed lightly by a dry finish and hop bitterness. This already-dry beer will get more so over time, as the Brett continues to chew away at residual sugars, increasing the amount of funk character in the beer (and, quite possibly, carbonation... you've been warned!). The [De Novo II Release Party](https://www.facebook.com/events/439429083080304/) is next **Thursday, June 29th**, at the taproom, from 6-10 pm. There's no charge to attend, just drop by for some music, cake, and pick up some hand-bottled _De Novo II_ while it's available!

• All year, Propeller Brewing is celebrating their 20th Anniversary, with several initiatives and collaborations and events planned. The details of their official Anniversary Party have been announced, taking place **July 8th**. From 2-8PM, they are taking over the parking lot of their neighbours Seven Bay Bouldering, and inviting some great local bands to play free concerts all day, also featuring games for young and old alike, beer specials, and plenty more surprises. After the day's fun, the party moves a few feet down the block to the Marquee, where Skratch Bastid and friends will be playing starting at 10PM. With tickets priced at $20, this is a steal of a deal, but even more so when realizing that 100% of profits will be going to the [North End Community Health Centre](http://nechc.com/), just down Gottingen from Propeller, and their favourite charity. Check out the [FB Events](https://www.facebook.com/events/1945898152314155/) page for more information, and [grab your tickets](http://www.tickethalifax.com/events/45371436/propeller-20th-birthday-bash-w-skratch-bastid-amp-special-guest) for the show at the Marquee before they sell out.
