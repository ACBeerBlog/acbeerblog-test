Happy Friday! As we're about ready to officially begin summer, the beer news is coming in fast and furious!

• We are thrilled to welcome the newest brewery to the Atlantic Canada region, [Tatamagouche Brewery](http://tatabrew.com/). Located at [235 Main Street](http://goo.gl/maps/7fKmk) in Tatamagouche, NS, this former butcher shop has been converted to a state-of-the-art brewery. We've been [following along](http://tatamagouchebrewster.wordpress.com/) with their progress for almost a year now, made a visit ourselves at the beginning of the month, and are excited to see their successful opening this week. They have launched with their _Hippie Dippie Pale Ale_, weighing in at 5% ABV and brewed exclusively with [**Ahtanum**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties#Ahtanum_brand_YCR_1_cv) hops. Their _Butcher Block Red Ale_ is a bit higher test at 6% ABV, and uses higher hopping levels of the [**El Dorado**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hop_varieties#El_Dorado) varietal, including the use of a [hopback](https://twitter.com/TataBrew/status/474281435025915905), which sits between the kettle and the chiller, for an extra dose of hops post-boil. We'll have a full profile with them shortly, but in the meantime, grab a growler at the brewery (open 10-6 daily), or on tap at the [Train Station Inn](http://www.trainstation.ca/) and [Stirling Room](http://stirlingroomclub.com/) in Tatamagouche, or the [Nook and Cranny](https://www.facebook.com/thenookandcrannytruro) in Truro. Welcome aboard the Craft Beer Train!

• [Grimross Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) is just about one year away from the date that they sold their first beer (July 1st, 2013), and they've got some big news just in time to celebrate! Owner/brewer Stephen Dixon has confirmed that they will be expanding, and moving to a new location in Fredericton. They've already ordered their brewing system; the move likely won't occur for another six months. In the meantime, they will continue brewing their regular line-up of beers at the [Picaroons' Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf) downtown. We'll have more details soon, but for now we can say we're very happy to hear this news!

• In other Grimross news, they're releasing a new beer, _Ben's Country Cousin_, at the Brewtique sometime tomorrow afternoon. This beer has the same grain bill as _Ben's Bitter Pale Ale_, a regular-release Grimross beer; however, it is hopped differently during the boil, and is dry-hopped, unlike the original recipe. As well, the beer is fermented with a Farmhouse Ale yeast, so overall look for it to taste quite different from _Ben's Pale_. It has an ABV of about 6%, like it's relative. Keep an eye on Grimross' [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GrimrossBrewing) account for exact details on what time the beer is released.

• [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) has announced the return of their very popular _Insidious IBA_. This [2013 Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/winners/years/2013/) medal-winner is an American West Coast-style India Black Ale. Dark roasted barley gives the beer its signature colour, but the flavour and aroma showcase the **Columbus**,** Citra**, **Simcoe**, **Summit**, **Centennial**, and **German Magnum** hops. Weighing in at 6.9% and 70 IBUs, this will be a popular beer for the start of summer. For those of you who want one more taste of the now sold-out [Intergalatic SMaSH'd Lager](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2014/05/smashd-lager.html), you'll have to grab a ticket to the Brewer's Dinner on June 24th to get it. We'll see you there!

• Halifax's [Granite Brewery](http://www.granitebreweryhalifax.ca/) will soon be re-releasing their summer seasonal, _Honey Ginger Ale_. Brewed with honey and ginger root, the ginger addition adds a natural bitterness to the beer, so no hops are used at any stage of the brewing process. A light-drinking beer at 4.6% ABV, it should be available for growler fills at the brewery's [beer store](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/6054+Stairs+St/@44.6607642,-63.6059665,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4b5a2173c63f7a1f:0xa4e10bdf0fa3ceb4) soon (hopefully by next weekend); keep an eye on Granite's [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GraniteBrewery) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/granitebrewery) accounts for the exact release date.

• We have some details on [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/)'s newest beer, an IPA, _Hops on for Nowhere_. This 75 IBU beer is hopped with three different varieties: **Waimea**, **Green Bullet**, and **Amarillo**, that according to the brewery provide a "comforting, earthy orange finish". Coming in at ~5.5% ABV, the first batch sold out for growler fills at the brewery; the next batch should be available late next week. They've also brewed up their _Honey Wheat Ale_ (made with local buckwheat honey) again; it's available now at the brewery for growler fills.

• [A couple of weeks ago](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/friday-wrap-up-20140606/), we reported on the new lager that was brewed by the [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) Just to update, this 4% ABV light lager (hopped with two New Zealand varieties, **Kohatu** and **Motueka**) has been named _Landing Day Lager_, and is now on tap at the [Gahan House](http://www.gahan.ca/), in addition to at the brewery itself ([96 Kensington Rd](http://goo.gl/maps/SuoE9)).

• It's back! The [Rare Bird Pub](http://www.rarebirdpub.com/) in Guysborough, NS, is opening today for the season. While they are brewing their _Rare Bird Pale Ale_ and _Full Steam Stout_ year-round, the Pub is only seasonal. Open 11:30-8pm Wed-Sun, drop by for a pint of their two year-round beers, as well as seasonals as they are released. Rare Bird growlers are also available for purchase at the Pub.

• [Bigtide Brewpub](http://bigtidebrew.com/) in Saint John, NB has a couple of new beers on tap lately, so let's get you caught up on their details. _Tin Can Porter_ is a brand new release, based on their _Chocolate Porter_, but incorporating fresh brewed [Java Moose](http://www.javamoose.com/) coffee at flame-out. The beer is hopped to 45 IBUs using **Nugget** and **Willamette** hops, and is 5% ABV. The addition of vanilla smooths out any bitterness from the coffee. The beer is named after Tin Can Beach, to celebrate the work that [ACAP Saint John](http://www.acapsj.org/tin-can-beach-field-guide/) is doing to clean up this area of the downtown.

• Also on tap at Bigtide is _Princess Street IPA_. This unfiltered IPA was brewed using **Nugget** hops exclusively throughout the 90-minute boil. The theoretical IBUs are up over 100, however the 7.5% ABV and slight residual sweetness help to round out any harsh bitterness. Canadian 2-Row and German Pale Ale are the major base malts, as well as a small amount of Caramunich and Carafoam for colour. Grab a pint at the bar, or a growler to go.

• [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) has been teasing us with the beers they will be pouring tomorrow at the [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) Cask Takeover. Here's the complete cask list:
_Spiceman's Session Saison_ (with Wild Voatsiperifery Peppers)
_Christmas in June_ ([Meander River](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) _Lunchbox Pale Ale_ and Garrison _Spruce Beer_ blend)
_Summit Buzz_ (Vanilla Espresso _Brown Ale_)
_Peanut Butter Jelly Time_ (peanut butter and fresh raspberries on their _Brown Ale_)
_Some Like it Hot_ (_Tall Ship Amber_ Michelada)
_Blueberry Raj_ (Spiced _American Wheat_ with blueberry juice and masala chai)
_Brand New and Already Bitter_ (IPA dry-hopped with Citra and Amarillo)
_Makin' Bacon_ (Maple Bacon Ale, using Chef Graeme's homemade bacon rum)
_Imperial Mystery_ (your guess is as good as ours, though we're guessing it's based on their _Imperial Pale Ale_)
_Lovers Quarrel_ (Belgian-style Wit with rosehips and chamomile)
_My Thai Wheat_ (American Wheat with pineapple mint and kaffir lime leaves)
_La Moreno Loco_ (Chocolate Chili Brown Ale, with homegrown chilis and dark chocolate and cocoa nibs)
For those without noon "First Sips" tickets, the doors open again at 2pm for first-come, first-served pours. $10 gets you a glass to keep, and your first drink.

• Come out to the [Wooden Monkey Dartmouth](http://www.thewoodenmonkey.ca/) **tonight**, starting at 7:30, to help celebrate the [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/) First Anniversary. In addition to Wooden Monkey's regular local beer rotation, there will be three special casks pouring: [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) _All Night Kitchen Party_ (double dry-hopped Pale Ale), Garrison _Sticky Toffee Pudding Birthday Cake_ (based on the _Sugar Moon Maple_), and [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) _Farmhouse Ale_. No tickets necessary (it's pay-as-you-enjoy), just show up to have a celebratory pint or two.

• And finally, we are very excited to announce the next big event scheduled at [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/). Jeff at [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/) has been brewing like crazy since opening just a few months ago, and will be taking over the taps (and casks) at Stillwell all day July 5th. Featuring twelve taps and two casks, there will be something for everyone that day: the much-anticipated return of _That's Falcon Teamwork_ (brewed with the Stillwell gang), barrel-aged versions of the _Impresser DIPA_ and _Black and Tackle RIS_ (as well as their non-barrel-aged versions), and the last keg of _Mosaic DIPA_. Among the six (SIX!) new beers debuting at the takeover, folks will have first crack at the _Smokehouse Lager_ (brewed with 100% Smoked Malt), _Apple Cider_, the _Summer Slurper Session Ale_, and a few more special beers that will blow people's socks off. So, how do you get in on the madness? Tickets for the noon (First Sips), afternoon, and evening sessions are on sale today at Stillwell. Unlike other events, you **will** need a ticket to get into the afternoon and evening sessions, so plan accordingly. As with other Takeovers, your $10 ticket gets you a glass and your first pour. We'll definitely see you there!

• And as a late addition, we just wanted to include the exciting news that [Les Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) has confirmed that they're in the process of brewing their first full batch of beer! This morning, brewers Jason Dionne and Gavin Anderson started brewing _Bob LeBouef_, their Blonde Ale. Look for the beer (and others) to be available sometime early next month!
