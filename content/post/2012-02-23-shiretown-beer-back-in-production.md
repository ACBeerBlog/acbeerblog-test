[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/shiretown2.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/shiretown2.jpg)As reported on their [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/shiretown), Shiretown Beer is available again at the Artisan Cafe & Brewpub in Dalhousie, New Brunswick.

Hops on for Nowhere, an American West Coast IPA with strong aroma and bitterness, is now available on tap and in growlers.  Production is not running at full capacity as of yet but their Blonde du Quai and Big Brown Ale will hopefully be available in the near future.
