[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/picaroons_logo.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/picaroons_logo.jpg)[Picaroon's](http://www.picaroons.ca/index.asp) will offer the [first public release of it's Cask conditioned beer](http://www.picaroonspub.com/profiles/blogs/cask-and-you-shall-receive) at the [Garrison District Alehouse](http://www.thegarrison.ca/) in Fredericton this Thursday at 4pm.  Yippee IPA will be the featured beer with fill ups of the same available in growlers next door at the Brewtique.

As the beer <del>geeks</del> <del>snobs</del> enthusiasts who tend to frequent this site know, [cask conditioned ale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cask_ale) is conditioned and served directly from the cask which results in a richer beer with [lots of character](http://www.cask-ale.co.uk/us/realale.html).  Cask conditioned ales are not commonly available due to the special care that is required to offer the brew so if you're in Fredericton this Thursday enjoy a pint or two!
