Happy April, everyone! Welcome to your guaranteed April-Fool's-Day-joke-free beer news post!

• After the very successful launch of their first bottled product, _Ra Ra Rasputin_ Barrel-Aged Russian Imperial Stout, Nyanza's [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) is releasing another big beer this week: _Barrel-Aged Coade Word: Snowmageddon_ Winter Warmer. The original _Coade Word_ spent a couple of months in [Glenora](http://www.glenoradistillery.com/) Single Malt Whisky barrels, and has taken on lots of barrel flavour (and a bit of alcohol, bringing it from 8.8% to 10.2% ABV). Bottles of _BACW:S_ are now available for purchase, and like the _RRR_, *only* available at the brewery. And, in the _spirit_ of keeping good things coming, a 9.0% Baltic Porter has been put into those barrels Glenora barrels, as well as a pair of and [Buffalo Trace](http://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/) Bourbon barrels, for a couple of months of aging and a release in the spring/summer. And keep an eye out for their _Spruce Bringstein_, a 6.3% ABV, 23 IBUs Amber hopped with **Magnum** and** Tettnang**, which should be pouring at BS tap accounts now/soon.

• Big Spruce is teaming up with [Lion & Bright](http://lionandbright.com/) to celebrate [Earth Day](http://www.earthday.org/) for the next three weeks. Starting today, and until April 21st, Big Spruce and Lion & Bright will donate $0.50 each per pint of Big Spruce beer served, to Halifax's [Ecology Action Centre](https://www.ecologyaction.ca/). On Earth Day itself, **April 22nd**, there will be a big celebration at Lion & Bright, with a whole bushel-full of Big Spruce beers flowing, and some locally-grown food to pair. Be sure to drop by Lion & Bright all month to show your support for the EAC!

• Halifax's [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/) is releasing a beauty today at noon, _Front Line Rocker_ Double IPA. Fermented using Vermont Ale yeast, and loaded with tons of hops, it is a super hoppy and juicy delight in your glass. Boasting 8% ABV and over 100 IBUs, this beer is big, bold, yet balanced. Grab a growler at Unfiltered starting at noon, or a glass at Charm School next door when it opens at 4pm.

• Halifax's [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is bringing back a cult favourite from the archives today... _Jalapeno Ale_! This 5.0% ABV pale ale features not just one, but **four** different peppers in the brew: Jalapeño, Habanero, Scotch Bonnet, and Jamaican Hot Pepper, for a unique contrast of big heat, with a refreshing beer backbone. In addition to the bold taste and aroma available when drinking the beer, it is a wiz in the kitchen, where it can be the base for a wicked marinade, or intense broth or beer cheese soup. The beer is available now at the brewery in bottles only, in a very limited supply.

• You may have also noticed a new Garrison beer on the shelves at both the brewery, and NSLC recently, _Hoppy Buoy IPA_. This 6.5% ABV American IPA features loads of **Citra**, **Columbus**, and **Galaxy** hops for a robust 50 IBU bitterness to build on the Maritime Malt and 2-Row malt bill. The hop-derived citrus and tropical aromas and flavours are enhanced by the addition of **Mango** juice to the beer, for a great juicy brew. This beer is replacing Garrison's _India Pale Ale_ in stores and on tap, so grab it today!

• And to celebrate the 30th anniversary of [Pro Skates](http://proskates.com/), Garrison has released a new non-alcoholic soda, called _Pro Cola_. Made with 100% natural cane sugar, it features real cola ingredients for a refreshing and tasty ode to this local business. Grab a bottle at the brewery today.

• [YellowBelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) has brought back an old favourite brew this week: _Black Gold_. This 4.5% ABV black ale features a large portion of Midnight Wheat in the malt bill (with the rest being pilsner malt), which imparts the dark colour, but without a lot of roast character. **Brewer's Gold** hops were used in the boil, and the beer was dry-hopped with **Cascade** and **Topaz**, for high-30s IBUs and a blackcurrant-like character. _Black Gold_ is on tap at the brewery now, with a limited bottle supply available there and at NLC stores starting today.

• [Bulwark](http://www.bulwarkcider.com/) has announced details of their newest creation, _Bulwark Uprooted_. This 7.0% ABV cider features beets on top of their signature cider blend, for a bright red colour, and interesting earthy yet clean and crisp meld in flavour and aroma. This unique blend is the official cider of [East Coast Music Week 2016](http://ecma.com/), being held in Sydney, NS, April 13-17. Featuring plenty of live music all weekend, and the East Coast Music Awards show on Thursday the 14th, there will be lots to do, and drink, while in the area. Look for the blend to be released soon, and will be on tap at some of the ECMW events, as well as wider release to the rest of the province.

• Last weekend, the [Picaroons General Store](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-General-Store/1749027828665617) opened in uptown Saint John, located at [32 Canterbury St](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Canterbury+St+%26+Grannan+St,+St+John,+NB+E2L,+Canada/@45.272325,-66.0633977,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4ca7b37da51f6b5f:0x294f408a2b6cd23e). Open Monday-Wednesday 10am-10pm, Thursday-Saturday 10am-11pm, and Sunday 12-8 pm, all the usual [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) products will be sold at this location (plus a new _Canterbury Pale_ on tap), including growlers and fills, bottles, and swag. There's also seating available if you'd like to relax with a pint, and food can be purchased and brought in from the [Real Food Connections](http://www.realfoodconnections.ca/pages/saintjohn) next door. Patrons can also expect to see some other local beverages on tap in the future. Check out the East Point [ANBL growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) station for a tap takeover this weekend, plus a visit from Picaroons' Ian Covey today from 4-8pm.

• [Spindrift Brewing's](http://spindriftbrewing.com/) 7th Wave release today is _Ming Tran_. A 4.6% ABV Pale Ale, it was fermented with _Brettanomyces_ yeast for a blast of pineapple esters that will kick you right in the face. As with all 7th Wave releases, this one is on tap for growler fills at the brewery only, starting today at noon.

Here's all the info you need on the many **events** going on in our region this week:
