Look at that, it's the weekend again already! And as usual, there's lots going on in the beer world...

• There's a new beer on the way from [Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/); coming out in a few days, it honours the departure of the [KB882 Lancaster Bomber](http://lancasterkb882.ca/en/) from Edmundston. The plane, which was responsible for many allied runs to occupied Europe during World War II, is being dismantled and moved to the Alberta Aviation Museum this summer. _Lancaster KB882_ is a special-edition "Amber Lager" brewed in the style of a Marzen/Oktoberfest. Starting off a bit sweet but finishing dry, it features a bready malt backbone, and is hopped to 23 IBUs with **Hallertauer**, a German noble variety, providing a light, supporting bitterness. Lagered for 6 weeks, it's an easy-drinking beer with a sessionable 4.6% ABV. Look for this one to be released this Monday, March 30th, at the brewery for growler fills; it should follow shortly at select ANBL growler stations as well.

• [YellowBelly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) has released their _Unite Red Ale_, brewed as part of the [International Women's Collaboration Brew Day](http://pinkbootssociety.org/iwcbd/). The guidelines from the Pink Boots Society suggested a 4.5% Red Ale with 50 IBUs using **Willamette**, but creative license was encouraged. To achieve these targets, Maris Otter and Extra Dark Crystal were used in the mash, along with a bit of Briess Midnight Wheat™ for colour. As wheat has no husk, there is no astringency or grain-based bitterness that may arise from other dark roasted cereals. To increase the hop bitterness level, higher alpha acid **Mosaic** hop was used early in the boil, to accompany the lower AA **Willamette** (with **Mosaic** also being used in the dry-hop). The resultant aroma is reminiscent of fruit punch, with notes of passionfruit and lychee up front, and lingering pink grapefruit. Overall, the beer tastes like more! The brewday report from Brewmaster Liam McKenna describes the many enthusiastic participants enjoying a beer brunch, taking turns in the brewhouse during the process, and even having a chance to do a hop drop. Money was raised for the [Newfoundland Sexual Assault Crisis and Prevention Centre](http://nlsacpc.com/), and there are already plans to make this an annual event. The _Unite Red Ale_ is on tap now at the brewery, with bottles coming to the brewery and NLC early next week. And a quick note that the next batch of _YellowBelly Pale Ale_, expected to hit the taps on Wednesday, also incorporates Mosaic for late- and dry-hopping, as a treat for the Island's fruit juicy hop lovers.

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) has released another one-off beer featuring an interesting ingredient: kelp! When approached by [Dr. Thierry Chopin](http://www2.unb.ca/chopinlab/) of UNB-SJ about brewing a beer featuring the brown algae, the Picaroons staff happily took on the challenge. Brewed with organic sugar kelp harvested off the shores near St. George, _Kelp on the Way_ also includes a "strong malt backbone" of Golden Promise, Dark Crystal, Roasted, and Smoked malts. Hopped with **Fuggles** and **Goldings** to 22 IBUs to help balance the sweetness, this 5.8% ABV beer is described by the brewery as dark, malty and smokey. It was released earlier this week, exclusively at the Brewtique for growler fills; if there's still any left, get down there to give it a try before it's all gone!

• There's Big things brewing at [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/)! Yesterday was the brewday for their first ever lager, and they chose a special style, a [Maibock](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style05.php#1a). And if that wasn't enough, they added the zest of 40 lemons to the boil, and will add the same during conditioning. The grist is primarily Pilsner malt, with Munich added for colour and flavour. The hops used included **Magnum** in the first wort, some Big Spruce-grown **Galena** for bittering and **Challenger** for flavour, for an estimated total 35 IBUs. After fermentation is complete (done using a Bavarian lager yeast), the beer will lager for 4-6 weeks, and be released during [NS Craft Beer Week](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/500/nova-scotia-craft-beer-week), May 8-17.

• In more Big Spruce news, they teased the upcoming brewing and release of a brand new beer coming in the summer. Based on notes from [Alexander Graham Bell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell), they will be releasing a sour raspberry wheat ale. Bell spent more than 30 years living in Baddeck, and a [Parks Canada National Historic Site](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/ns/grahambell/index.aspx) in Baddeck bears his name. His notes describe an interesting tart drink with raspberries, and Big Spruce was approached to produce something in that same vein. The sour character of the brew will be accomplished using the _kettle souring_ technique, using _Lactobacillus_ to ferment the wort and give a tart and acidic character not available from brewer's yeast. We will have more on this beer, which will be released in coordination with [The Bells of Baddeck](http://www.bellsofbaddeck.com/), a musical drama running during the month of July.

• And finally in Big Spruce news, their _Island Conspiracy_, brewed with [BarNone Brewing's](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) Don Campbell, is now available. This Double IPA, weighing in at 8% ABV and 97 IBUs (bittered with **Magnum**, flavoured with **Bravo**, **Citra** and **Cascade**, with these last two hops also used in aromatic additions) hit the taps at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) last night, and is available on tap today at the brewery today for growler fills. Look for it on tap elsewhere in fine bars across the province, and rumour has it that BarNone may brew it at their brewery for release in PEI at some point.

• While [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/)'s opening at their new location had been slightly delayed to around April 1st, they're still busy brewing new beer. The latest one-off is _Smoked Maple Porter_, an 8%ABV dark ale with a grist consisting of several malts: 2-row, Chocolate, Black, Brown, Carafoam, Crystal 120 L, and, of course, Smoked. Hopped with **Fuggles** and **Centennial** to 22 IBUs, the beer also had 2 L of maple syrup added while in the primary fermentor. Look for this one to be on tap at the new 6-tap tasting room once it opens in the hopefully-near future. And owner/brewer Mitch Biggar has a lot of new beers planned, including an _Orange Cranberry Rye_, _Chipotle Chaga Porter_, and an 8-hop version of their _Trainwreck IPA_; we'll be sure to keep you updated as these beers are brewed and released. In the meantime, the brewery itself will be open tomorrow-on for growler fills of their _Artisan Brown_, during regular hours (Mon-Sat noon - 10 pm, Sun noon - 5 pm).

• [Meander River Farm and Brewery](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) is having a special release this weekend, their first Cider! A blend of Cortland, McIntosh, Honeycrisp and Golden Delicious apples have gone in to this first batch of cider, finishing at 6.5% ABV. Citrus and apple notes are predominant in the cider. This is a very limited release, with only 200 litres available; it is expected to sell out this weekend at the Brewery (though it will make a brief appearance on tap in Halifax, as well). Going forward, they anticipate making cider a part of their rotating offerings, with Meander River's own fruits and wild apples possibly making it into the recipes.

• This is a busy weekend at Meander River, as it is also the return of their _Smokey Chipotle Porter_, first released in October 2014. The malt bill features Cherrywood Smoked Malt, along with darker kilned malts for a smoke and roast/chocolate character. Chipotle peppers were added late in the fermentation for an additional smoke character, as well as a spicy punch and pepper flavour. The peppers were left in the beer longer this time for a bit more of a kick. They also announced that they have brought in two additional conditioning tanks, allowing them to brew more often, and effectively triple capacity to 450 hectolitres per year.

• Summer is still a few months away (and let's be honest, it feels even longer than that), but there's some good news for beer fans living in Fredericton for the season: those behind the recently-redefined [James Joyce Pub](https://www.facebook.com/FoodatTheCrownDowntown) are planning a summer craft beer garden at the [Lighthouse on the Green](https://www.facebook.com/FredLighthouse​) downtown. Right now, plans are to have 3 taps pouring - two Picaroons, and one NB-brewery rotating tap - along with a BBQ on the deck for food purchases. Details are still being ironed out, but expect the beer garden to open with limited hours around mid-June, and then all day (11 am - 10 pm) in July and August. We'll keep you updated on its progress; be sure to follow the Facebook link for the Lighthouse above, as all updates/beer notices/etc. will flow through there.

• Calling all Islanders... PEI's newest craft brewery, [Upstreet Craft Brewing](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com), needs your help! In preparation for their grand opening later this spring, they're looking to include something "different" in each bottle when they begin packaging their beers: "Islandisms" ("Islanderisms?") under every cap! They're asking for your assistance; any PEI-specific phrases, quotes, jokes, etc. you can think of are fair-game, as long as they're relatively clean! You can suggest as many as you like via Twitter, Facebook or Instagram; just be sure to include the hashtag **#UnderTheCap**. The best 250 will garner laughter and fame in future bottles of Upstreet beer! Get cracking, you have until next Friday to submit your ideas.

• Congratulations are in order to [Sunset Heights Meadery](http://sunsetheightsmeadery.com/), producers of the Pollen Angels line of sparkling meads available in the Fredericton area. Their _Bee Mine_ chocolate and cherry expression took home a Silver medal in the Session Mead - Sweet category at the [2015 Mazer Cup](http://mazercup.com/). They have celebrated the win by releasing a limited number of bottles to several restaurants and bars in the area ([The Grad House at UNB](http://www.unb.ca/studentlife/fredericton/), [Isaac's Way](http://isaacsway.ca), [Relish](http://relishyou.ca), [James Joyce Pub](http://www.cpfredericton.com/en/restaurants-dining/james-joyce), [Wolastoq Wharf](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wolastoq-Wharf/409038465825993?ref=ts&fref=ts), and [McGinnis Landing](http://www.mcginnislanding.ca/)). Available by the glass only,

• Tickets go on sale today for Sunset Heights' first Still Mead release, scheduled for the afternoon of April 11th. The event will feature Mead pairing with chocolate and cheese, and first availability to buy one of their four new still meads released at that time. Each attendee is able to purchase up to two cases, and will have first access to tickets to the upcoming Summer and subsequent release and tasting events. Be sure to check their [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/sunsetmead) to get first crack at the tickets when they go on sale at noon, as they are limited to only 36!

• [Tom's Little Havana](http://tomslittlehavana.wix.com/cafe) announced earlier this week that they will be hosting their first Tap Takeover, and it will be by perennial favourite [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/). Over four days, beginning May 14th, there will be five different BAB beers on tap, with a special cask being released each day. No tickets required for the event, just show up to enjoy great beer and food.

• [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) has released their newest beer, _Freudian Slip_ Vienna Lager. A light and crisp golden lager, it features toasted malt and spicy and herbal noble hop characters. It weighs in at 5.5% ABV and 30 IBUs.

• [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has brought back their very popular _La Rive du Sud_, first released in May 2014. This [Biere de Garde](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style16.php#1d) style beer is a malty, lagered beer (though initially fermented with an ale yeast), with origins in France, where the summer months were too hot for brewing, so beer was brewed and stored in the cellar during the cooler months to enjoy once the weather warmed. It features light base malts and dark caramelized sugar, and is 7.5% ABV. Available at the brewery now in bottles and growler fills, bottles will be available this weekend in Halifax (and growlers at the Seaport Market), and on tap at select bars soon. And their _The Next Chapter_ Rye IPA has finally hit store shelves this week, and is moving fast. [Check here](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/ProductDetails/4513) for availability at your local ANBL.

• [Hammond River's](http://hrbrewing.ca/) [_Switchback Brown Ale_](http://acbeerblog.ca/2014/10/24/friday-wrap-up-oct-24th/) is being featured at the[ ANBL Growler fill program](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) this week. This is the first time in a while that Hammond River has brewed the hoppy American Brown; the same recipe has been used, since the beer was so well-received during its first run. Head to the Kennebecasis Valley ANBL to pick up a growler, as the beer will be available exclusively at this location. And they've recently brewed the last batch for this season of their _Breakfast Stout_; this brew features the [Java Moose](http://www.javamoose.com/) coffee, oats, cacao nibs, and home-smoked bacon as before, along with a few eggs being added this time (to the mash) to make your "breakfast" complete! Finally, look for their _Hawaiian Pale Ale_ (brewed with fresh pineapples) to be available again soon (it will be debuting for the season at this year's [Saint John Beer Fest](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest) on April 11th).

Enjoy your weekend! [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has a new one-off beer, _Cranberry Hibiscus Wit_, available at the brewery for growler fills; tart and sessionable at 4% ABV. [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co/301456876447) has an unfiltered version of their _Seaworthy IPA _(featuring **Nugget** and **Cascade** hops) on tap at the brewpub. [Shiretown's](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/) _Black Currant Wheat_ is back, available for growlers fills at the brewery, and on tap at the [Heron's Nest Pub](https://www.facebook.com/HeronsNestPub). And the new batch of [TrailWay Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing)'s _Session IPA_ is now available at [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/), James Joyce, and at their newest account, [Brewbakers](http://brewbakers.ca/).
