[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/nlbeer_bluestar_bavarianbrewing_1965_b1.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/nlbeer_bluestar_bavarianbrewing_1965_b1.jpg)Chris Conway is a native of Newfoundland and a current PhD candidate at the University of Toronto who has created a website dedicated to tracking the history of brewing in Newfoundland aptly titled [Newfoundland Beer History](http://nlbeerhistory.com/).

The main section of the website contains timelines and labels from [brewers' past](http://nlbeerhistory.com/).

The [research blog section](http://nlbeerhistory.com/research-blog/) of the website is updates of recent posts related to brewing history and also has overviews of brewers past and present with their related brands and timelines.

There is also a related [Tumblr account](http://nlbeerhistory.tumblr.com/) with a hilarious poster for Oland's Export Ale (would love to know what year this is, far before the term politically correct was invented).

Definitely a site worth checking out for history and / or beer enthusiasts.
