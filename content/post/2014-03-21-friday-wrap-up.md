Happy Friday, one and all. We hope you've recovered from Monday's festivities, wherever/however you may have celebrated!

• [Paddys Irish Brewpub](http://www.paddyspub.ca/) has tapped their latest seasonal release, “Solo Citra”. This Pale Ale beer weighs in a 5.3% ABV and 50 IBUs, with a colour reminiscent of Tangerines and a light body at 1.005 FG. Thanks to the generous dosing of Citra hops, the beer features plenty of citrus flavour and aroma, as well as a significant bitterness, thanks to the light body. It is available now at both the Kentville and Wolfville locations on tap and in growlers.

• [BarNone Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) recently announced that they're brewing a new beer to help celebrate this year's 150th anniversary of the [Charlottetown Conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottetown_Conference), and tying it in with a special event at [Baba's Lounge](http://www.cedarseatery.com/Babamain.html). From April 1st-7th, Baba's is holding a 150-hour long music jam in honor of the sesquicentennial; when Don Campbell (brewer/co-owner at BarNone) asked what type of beer they wanted him to brew for the event, they decided on a Red Ale. Don soon came up with "RedEye", a hoppy Amber brewed with 150 kg of malt and 150 oz of hops, with a 150 minute boil time. Coming in at - you guessed it - 150 IBUs and a color of 15 SRM, it will be served exclusively at Baba's for the music jam. After that, it may pop up on tap at other restaurants/bars in the area, and will likely be available for Thursday growler fills at the brewery.

• Shane Steeves of [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) has confirmed that he is planning on brewing a new beer in the near future. While details on the recipe are still slim, we can confirm that it will be an Imperial IPA weighing in at about 8.6% ABV and 100 IBUs. The beer will be brewed soon, after Steeves returns from a much-deserved vacation; we'll keep you updated as to when and where the beer will be released.

• In other Hammond River news, they've recently rebrewed their Hop Flash IPA; this time it's been dry-hopped with two different hop varieties than previous batches. It should be on tap in the Saint John area in a few days... if you can guess the two hop varieties used, post it on their [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery/posts/734360046582365) to win a Hammond River ball cap!

• Expansion continues over at [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/), as they recently confirmed that they will soon be shipping their beer to Ontario! The first shipment will consist of their Fathers 2014 Commemorative 4-packs, which include renamed and relabelled bottles of their Blueberry Ale, Coles Cream Ale, Iron Bridge Brown, and Sir John A's Honey Wheat. More on this Anniversary release in our previous post [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/friday-wrap-up-20140110/).

• The Duo Wine Bar at [The Tide & Boar Gastropub](http://www.tideandboar.com/) in Moncton is having their second beer dinner next Wednesday, March 26th. Hosted by chef Michael Savoie, there will be five courses, all paired with a different craft beer; some of the beers include a Picaroons cask ale, a "surprise IPA", and some highly-rated Belgian beers. Accompanied by such courses as lobster crostini and a marinated salmon with hop salad, the event is almost sold out. Tickets are $115 (inc. tax and gratuity); if you'd like to reserve, [email Duo](mailto:duo<at>tideandboar.com).

• As promised a couple of weeks ago, [Hell Bay's](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) R.I.P.(A.) version 2.0 is now available. Featuring the same base recipe, but triple the hops (but still a smooth, non-overwhelming bitterness), it is available at the brewery in growlers, and will be on tap in Halifax very shortly.

• And finally this week, [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is releasing their latest seasonal, the Baltic Porter, today. This dark and rich beer weighs in at 9% ABV and 30 IBUs, featuring lots of roast character. Bottles are available at the brewery, and shortly at the private stores. Also look for it on tap at better beer establishments in our region. The winner of the 2013 Home Brew-off, _Saint Peter’s Belgian-Style Strong Ale _is being released Monday (not today, as we originally posted), look for it at the brewery and private stores, as well as on tap at a few bars in the city.
