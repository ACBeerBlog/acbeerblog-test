Happy Friday, everyone! We hope your "Back to School" Week went well, and now you're ready to enjoy the local beer news with a pint in your hand.

• [BarNone Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) has a new beer on the go, a Black IPA they've named _Black Eye P.A._ A dark-colored beer that isn't high in roasted flavors or aromas, thanks to the sole use of [Blackprinz Malt](http://www.brewingwithbriess.com/Assets/PDFs/Briess_PISB_BlackprinzMalt.pdf) (which has been dehusked, making it less likely to cause an astringent mouthfeel), it is hopped heavily with several varieties, including **Pilgrim** and **Amarillo**. Coming in at 5.5% ABV, it should be ready in a couple of weeks; look for it at [Baba's Lounge](http://www.cedarseatery.com/Babamain.html) and for growler fills at the brewery soon!

• [We mentioned a few weeks ago](https://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/friday-wrap-up-20140815/) that [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) had brewed a new beer, their _Watermelon Wheat_. Well, that beer is now ready and currently pouring at the [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/) and [Bourbon Quarter](https://www.facebook.com/bourbonquarter). Brewed with lots of fresh watermelon, this light-colored and light-drinking Fruit Beer finished at about 20 IBUs and 5.6% ABV. It's the last summer seasonal for Hammond River, so make sure you try it ASAP! They've also confirmed that they'll be brewing a Harvest Ale, Pumpkin Ale and Vanilla Porter in the near future... we'll keep you updated as to the status of those new beers, soon.

• The wait for Fredericton-brewed Mead is almost over! [Sunset Heights Meadery](https://www.facebook.com/SunsetHeightsMeadery) has confirmed that they have been approved to receive their Manufacturer's Agency Store (MAS) license, which means that they are now able to sell directly to bars/restaurants and the public (e.g. via farmer's markets). Their first batch will be available this Sunday at the annual [The Feast in the Field](http://www.tourismnewbrunswick.ca/Products/F/Feast-In-The-Field.aspx) in downtown Fredericton; they hope to have other products available for purchase by the end of this month. Stay tuned for more news as to which brands they will have available, and where. For more info on Sunset Heights Meadery, check out our [previous post](https://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/04/10/sunset-heights-meadery-opening-soon-in-fredericton-new-brunswick/).

• The Halifax location of the [Gahan House Pub](http://www.gahan.ca/) is now open! The interior redesign and brewery expansion is complete, and the Pub opened to customers last night. Currently on tap are two beers brewed on site, _Hippie Cousin IPA_ and _Beer and Loathing Belgian Ale_. Joining them on tap are eight more of the full lineup of Gahan/PEI Brewing beer, and seasonals _Harvest Time Lager_ and _Black Banks Cascadian Dark Ale_. There are also taps from other locals: [Granite Brewery](http://www.granitebreweryhalifax.ca/) _Hopping Mad_, [Bulwark](http://www.bulwarkcider.com/) _Cider_ and [Picaroons](http://www.picaroons.ca/) _Yippee IPA_ and bottles from a dozen more breweries from the region are available.

• [Antigonish Townhouse](http://antigonishtownhouse.wordpress.com/) has announced a beer and food dinner, scheduled for September 20th. As part of the [50% Local Food Club](http://nslocalfoodclub.wordpress.com/) events to "Meet Farmers Halfway" taking place across the province this month, they will be highlighting items from their local food producers throughout September, culminating in this dinner. It will feature four to five courses of local food, each course paired with beer brewed on-site or from [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) in Nyanza. Guests can look forward to Antigonish lamb, pork, cheese, Mabou Oysters and homemade breads, and the farmers and producers will be on hand to share their stories. Tickets are not yet on sale, but keep on eye on their Twitter and Facebook pages to grab them when available. One of the beers being poured will be _Terry's Porter_, a new beer that debuted at last week's Friday afternoon cask. It will also be tapped at 5pm today, so be sure to show up for a pint and food tonight!

• Wednesday night marked the Fifteenth Anniversary of [Pump House Brewery](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/), and their **Stone Drop Event** went off without a hitch! Using a kiln and several propane tanks, they heated stones to over 600C, and dropped them in the wort to boil the beer. The intense heat caramelizes the sugars as they drop in the wort, so once cool, the stones come out covered in sugar. Participants were encouraged to taste the wort and lick the stones to get an idea of the final product, which will be hitting shelves in October. Both [CTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksj2zoM7jk4) and [CBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HKxR-UGR4o) were there to cover the event, check out their videos for the fun. Congratulations to Shaun Fraser and the whole Pump House crew on the event, and fifteen great years in business!

• The latest One Hit Wonder from [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has been released this week, _Orbit Ale_. Weighing in at 5.6% ABV and 35 IBUs, the beer features [**Orbit**](http://www.hopslist.com/hops/dual-purpose-hops/895-orbit) hops from New Zealand. We also learned that they have brewed up their very popular Pumpkin Ale beer this week, using [Howard Dill pumpkins](http://www.howarddill.com/dill-farm.html), so look for it at the end of September.

• In preparation for their brewery opening, hopefully this month, [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) is holding a label/design contest on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.506447252825596.1073741846.466756623461326&type=1) for their _Railcar Red_. Check out the excellent submissions and submit a vote (by Liking) for your favourites, before Sept 11 at noon AST.

• Several breweries have brewed up Harvest or Wet-Hop Beers this week, that will be hitting the taps/shelves over the next few weeks. We spotted pictures from [Meander River Farm and Brewery](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) and Big Spruce, both featuring their own on-premises grown hops, and Picaroons, who will brew several in their Harvest series, single-sourced from hop growers in our region. First up was a **Centennial** beer, courtesy of [Southan Farms](http://www.southanfarms.net/) in Wicklow, NB.

• The inaugural Atlantic Canada Beer Awards were announced this week. This [BJCP](http://www.bjcp.org/)-sanctioned competition is open to all commercial breweries and brewpubs in our region, with judging taking place October 4th, and the Awards Gala at the [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) October 5th. We look forward to taking part and celebrating the great beers and brewers in our region! We will have full details on the Awards, and beer-filled weekend, next week.
