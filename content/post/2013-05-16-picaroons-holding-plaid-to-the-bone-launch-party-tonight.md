Tonight, at the [Boyce Farmers Market](http://frederictonfarmersmarket.ca/) in Fredericton, [Pica](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons)[roons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) will be hosting a launch party for their "Heather Ale", Plaid to the Bone. Originally brewed in 2012 for the [New Brunswick Highland Games](http://www.highlandgames.ca/hg/news.html), Plaid to the Bone was named in a contest that Picaroons held on Facebook. A golden-colored beer brewed with heather, a flowering plant that grows abundantly in Scotland, Plaid to the Bone clocks in at a sessionable ~4.5% ABV.

There will be three bands playing live music at the event: [THE MAHONES](http://www.themahones.ca/home.php), [Sprag Session](http://spragsession.com/), and [Ten Strings and a Goat Skin](http://www.tenstringsandagoatskin.com/). The event starts at 7:00 p.m.; early arrivals will have access to some local food provided by [Real Food Connections](http://realfoodsfredericton.ca/). Tickets are $15, and can be purchased at the door.

Aside from the great music and grub, Plaid to the Bone will be available on tap, as well as Picaroons' Dooryard, Best Bitter, and Irish Red.

All proceeds will go to [The Fredericton Society of Saint Andrew Pipe Band](https://www.facebook.com/FSSAPB).
