Railcar, closing fall 2016 or not?

July 7th:

For fall we are going to revamp our retail hrs and we purchased a semi auto filler / capper that will help reduce some labor. If my health holds up we will still be going just with reduced hrs

Upstreet - barrel age program, hold off at least 12/30.

Received 18 Bourbon barrels: Imperial Chocolate Lager (4), Wee Heavy (4), Whisky Sour (4), Golden Cherry Brett (4), Smoked Porter (1), Vanilla Cranberry Stout (1). Won't start releasing till the fall, 500 mL bottles, will be named something different than One Way.

Hogie will let us know when to mention... **wants to hold off on the specific beer types till August or Sept, now.**
