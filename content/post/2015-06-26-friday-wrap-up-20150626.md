Happy Friday, folks! Breweries are in full Summer mode now, so there's lots of news and new beers to share with y'all! And be sure to grab a growler or two of something tasty Tuesday, so that you can be sipping on local suds to celebrate Canada Day Wednesday! Can you tell we're excited? Yup, we are!

• Earlier this week, [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) launched their Cask Program at their [Kensington Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Prince+Edward+Island+Brewing+Company/@46.252668,-63.1153749,17z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x4b5e52be39678e25:0x2def3dc28e2964fa!2s96+Kensington+Rd,+Charlottetown,+PE+C1A+5J4,+Canada!3b1!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xbc42d79a9cce3025) location. Throughout the summer, they will be rotating through special casks of beer on their hand pump at the bar. Currently on is the "BourbAnne of Green Gables", their _Island Red_ dosed with bourbon-soaked wood chips. These local casks will not take away from the special beers that they've been sending to [Bar Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/), however, and we have heard that there are two new sour beers heading across the Northumberland soon: one was casked with dandelion wine must and another with cold extracted [Receiver coffee](https://www.facebook.com/receivercoffeeco).

• And speaking of PEI Brewing, these Island Brews have taken over the [Board Room Game Cafe](http://www.boardroomgames.ca/)'s taps this weekend, with seven different brews pouring. Staple brews _1772 IPA_ and _Iron Bridge Brown_ are joined by seasonals _Blueberry Ale_, _Sydney Street Stout_, and special brews _Blood Orange IPA_, _Vic Park APA_, and _Setting Day Saison_. More details can be found at the Facebook [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1454950068138139). But be warned, there's only one of each keg, so visit early to avoid disappointment! Flights of four beers can be purchased for $7.95.

• [Bulwark](http://www.bulwarkcider.com/) is releasing a new cider,_ Sour Cherry Cider_.  The Cider weighs in at 7.5% ABV, and features their signature blend of Annapolis Valley-grown apples, with a special sour cherry base added (including some Valley-grown cherries) for a great sour cherry blast, and rich red colour. This celebratory Canada Day cider is **only** available on tap at the following locations in Halifax (sorry, no bottles): [Economy Shoe Shop](http://www.economyshoeshop.ca/), [Gahan House](http://halifax.gahan.ca/), [Lion & Bright](http://lionandbright.com/), [Old Triangle](http://www.oldtriangle.com/welcome/), [RockHead](http://www.rockhead.ca/) [for growler fills], [Scanway Cafe](http://scanwaycatering.com/bakery-cafe/), Stillwell (both Barrington and the Beergarden), and [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/). Keep an eye on their social media feeds to check when this treat is flowing! And keep an eye out for Bulwark's new branding, with their Original blend now being available in 6-packs at the NSLC and private stores.

• There's a beer on tap at the [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co/301456876447) brewpub in Saint John that hasn't been available for awhile - _Gesner's Deluxe Copper Ale_. Only available about once every year or two, it's brewed with 2-row and Pale Ale malts for the base, with lots of CaraMunich and some Carafa specialty malts to add caramel and bready notes to the aroma and flavour of the beer. This particular batch was hopped with **Simcoe** to about 50 IBUs, adding some pine and citrus notes. Quite drinkable at 4.8% ABV, it won't be around long, so be sure to drop by the brewpub for a pint and/or growler fill!

• And in other exciting Big Tide news, they will once again be hosting [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301) owner/brewer Patrice Godin this weekend for another collaboration brew. This time around, they're tackling Gose, an increasing-in-popularity, tart German style that usually features the addition of salt and coriander. Godin and Big Tide brewmaster Wendy Papadopoulos have decided to use Bay of Fundy water to provide the salty flavour typical to this style (Godin's day job as a water microbiologist comes in handy at times!). The beer will also be sour-mashed to provide the signature sour and tart flavours expected in the style. Stay tuned for more info on this beer in the near future.

• There's a new beer currently fermenting at [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307), a "Table Oat Saison". Featuring a grist made-up entirely of oats, owner/brewer Stephen Dixon was naturally preparing for a very challenging mash, as the oats would no doubt cause issues, as they take much longer on their own to convert their starches to sugars (3 hours, in this particular case) than other grains. **Magnum** hops were used for the bittering addition, and **Hallertau** for taste and aroma. Fermented with the Grimross house yeast, the beer should come in around 4% ABV and 25 IBUs, making it a true "Table" beer. We'll let you know when this beer is pouring at the brewery!

• Earlier this week, [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing?fref=ts) released the second iteration of _Patio_, one of their summer seasonals. As the name implies, this 4.5% ABV ale is meant to be a sessionable and refreshing beer to enjoy outdoors in the summer weather. A "Session Wheat Beer", the first version was hopped with **Chinook** and **Cascade**, and had some orange zest added after primary fermentation. This time around, the beer was hopped a little heavier, solely with** Comet** (a citrusy/grapefruit-y variety that is found in many TrailWay hoppy beers), with no orange zest added. It can currently be found at several establishments in Fredericton that serve TrailWay beers. Look for future versions to feature further changes, until the beer is retired at the end of the season.

• It's [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/)'s first anniversary, and they're celebrating in style! Tomorrow, June 27th, they will be hosting a free open house at the brewery in Edmundston from 1 - 6 pm, featuring beer tastings and pulled pork sliders. A terrace will be open for drinking and socializing, and when you purchase your first full pour, you get to keep the glass! A special surprise birthday firkin will be tapped at 4 pm, and there will be a short ceremony at 6 pm. Live music from Les Bagosseux will start shortly after, at 6:30. Happy anniversary to all the hard workers at the brewery, and cheers to many more years!

• [Sea Level Brewing](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) has brought back their _Southern Cross IPA_. The beer weighs in at 6.5%, and features both the New Zealand **Southern Cross** and Australian **Ella** hop varietals (in fact, it was dry-hopped in two stages with **Ella**). The bold hop bitterness clocks in at 80 IBUs, and showcases some nice citrus and subtle pine characters. It is available now at the [Port Pub](http://www.theportpub.com/), at [Harvest Wines](http://www.harvestwines.ca/store/) in cans, and [Obladee Wine Bar](http://obladee.ca/) on tap. It will also be pouring at the [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) growler station shortly.

• Speaking of Bishop's Cellar, their new 5-tap growler system has been installed by Ken Greer and crew of [BeerTech](http://www.beertech.ca/), and the beer is now flowing on the waterfront. Despite their small retail space, they've managed to install a cooler to house the direct draw system, with taps mounted directly on the wall. They are focusing on serving beers not otherwise available in the HRM, skipping those that are handily found in bottles or cans. They offer fills of both the 32 oz and 64 oz (0.95 and 1.89 litre) growlers, and customers can either buy a [Bishop's growler](https://www.facebook.com/BishopsCellar/photos/a.10151522231509020.1073741825.77839079019/10153340806124020/?type=1&theater), or bring their own clean bottles. They do have a rinse station, for a last blast of water to reduce foaming. At launch, they are pouring [Garrison's](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) _Coast to Coastless_ Collaboration Imperial ESB, [Good Robot](http://wroughtironbrewing.ca/) _Crown on the Ground_ Steam, [Granite Brewery](http://www.granitebreweryhalifax.ca/) _Hopping Mad_ IPA, [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) _Halifornia Common_, and [Tatamagouche](http://tatabrew.com/) _Butcher Block_ Red. The current lineup will be posted on their [Beer page](https://bishopscellar.com/beer/), and that page highlights the new arrivals and specials they are featuring at any given time. To go with their expanded beer offerings, they will be doing more beer tastings as part of their regular events, and have even been sneaking in a beer or two during their regular wine tastings. Drop by today at 5pm for the official public launch, and to fill up your growlers!

• More news on the progress of [Savoie's Brewhouse](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Savoies-Brewhouse/1617785005132093?fref=ts), the soon-to-open brewery in Charlo, New Brunswick: owner/brewer Rodney Savoie has confirmed that the first two flagship beers, _Island Lake Blonde_ and _Chaleur Phantom Amber Ale_, have successfully made it through the ANBL tasting panel. Next up is lab testing, followed by an ANBL listing, and then it's official - their beer will be ready for sale! We'll continue to keep you updated on their progress.

• The latest beer offering from [Newfoundland Labrador Artisanal and Craft Beer Club](http://www.nlacbc.ca/) is now open, and this time it focuses on Belgium. Coming to the [NLC](http://www.nlliquor.com/) in October are: _Saison Dupont_, _Halve Maan Brugse Zot Blonde_, _Oud Beersel Oude Kriek_, and _DeuS Brut des Flandres_. While the beers will be available to all NLC customers, these sign-ups give the Club an idea as to how popular the orders will be, to ensure there's enough to go around. Your input is much appreciated, please fill out the [order form](http://www.nlacbc.ca/beer-offerings/offering-19-belgium) today.

• And speaking of the NLACBC, they are holding a unique beer (or wine, if you prefer) tasting event July 9th. They will be visiting [St. Michael's Printshop](http://www.stmichaelsprintshop.com/) on Harbour Drive, and pairing beer or wine with Italian cheese, and different printmaking techniques. A different Trou du Diable beer (or Sauvignon Blanc wine) will accompany each of four stops along the tour. [This poster](http://www.nlacbc.ca/wp-content/uploads/art-at-the-printshop.pdf) has more info, and email [Tom Beckett](mailto:tom.beckett@nl.rogers.com) to sign up today (there are just a few spots left).

• [Cristall Wine Merchants](http://www.cristallwinemerchants.com/store/) in Sunnyside Mall have also begun filling growlers at their location, featuring four taps. Currently pouring are: _Cristall Pale Ale_ (brewed for them by Garrison), [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) _Kitchen Party_ Pale Ale, Tatamagouche _Butcher Block_ Red, and Sea Level _Rojo Mojo Red_. Keep an eye on their [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/CristallWine) for updates to the lineup.

• [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) in Sydney will be opening this weekend! Kegs of their _Stirling Hefeweizen_ and _Black Angus IPA_ have been filled, and being delivered to restaurants and bars as you read this. They will be having a soft opening at the brewery Saturday 10-5pm, so be sure to drop by and grab a growler or two to go. Their tap room, and _Sons of Hector Brown Ale_, will be open and pouring very soon. Congratulations Andrew and Bryan!

• [Stillwell Beergarden](http://www.barstillwell.com/beergarden) has been a popular spot during the sporadic lovely days available recently, pouring 10 lines of exclusively-Nova Scotian beer, cider, wine, and non-alcoholic drinks (including cold brewed coffee and lemonade). Now you can keep track of the Beergarden's status, as it is heavily dependent on the weather. Save [http://www.barstillwell.com/beergarden](http://www.barstillwell.com/beergarden) in your list of bookmarks, to stay in the loop.

• [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/)'s canning line has been busy this week, and these boat- and beach-friendly packages will be available this weekend at the brewery. As their bottle stock decreases, _Hippie Dippie Pale Ale_, _North Shore Lagered Ale_, and _Butcher Block Red_ canned versions will be replacing them. Their current seasonal, _RR#2_, will also be available next week at the brewery. Beginning July 4th, the cans will also be available at their Farmer's Market stand. Cans will be the package of choice for all but their Giant Beer series (_Giantess Barleywine_ _, Two Rivers Baltic Porter_, and _Rum Barrel-Aged Dreadnot IBA_, all still available for purchase at the brewery) going forward. Folks shopping at the brewery are welcome to mix their own 12-pack, and will save $0.25 per can when buying in 12-packs (or more).

• [Meander River](https://www.facebook.com/MeanderRiverFarm) has released their collaboration with Garrison's Daniel Girard, _Surf & Turf_. It is a Strong Scotch Ale, featuring Seaweed and Peated Malt in the mash, giving the beer a "rich, complex flavour of scotch, sweet caramel, slight salt, and roasted malt", according to the brewery. This 6.2% ABV, deep copper-coloured ale was brewed for the [Taste of Nova Scotia](http://tasteofnovascotia.com/) "Dinner on the Ocean Floor" event, which starts this weekend. You can also find the beer on tap at the brewery this weekend.

• The cask list for Saturday's [Ladies Beer League](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/) 2nd Birthday at the [Wooden Monkey](http://www.thewoodenmonkey.ca/) Dartmouth has been finalized: [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/)'s _Tim's Dirty American IPA_, [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) Collaboration _Rule 42 English IPA _, [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) _Dry-Hopped Imperial IPA_, and [North Brewing Company](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) _Summer Saison with Sour Cherries_. [Tickets](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ladies-beer-league-2nd-birthday-party-tickets-17285551550) are still available for the pizza, beer, and cake extranvaganza.

Have a great weekend, and Canada Day Wednesday! Speaking of, it's your last chance to snatch up the few remaining tickets for the [Canada Day Bash](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/canada-day-bash-tickets-17100311492) in Fredericton at the [Lighthouse on the Green](http://www.lighthouseonthegreen.ca/), featuring lots of local craft beer, BBQ, and fireworks! [Hell Bay](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) has released their _Hell's Anvil Smoked Stout_, brewed for the [CanIRON X event](http://canironx.ca/), and have a very limited number of bottles available at their Liverpool brewery. [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) has announced that they will now be at the [St. Andrews Farmers' Market](http://standrewsfarmersmarket.com/) every Thursday from 8 am - 1 pm for flagon fills.  The [Moncton Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/MonctonBeerLeague) is hosting a [NS Craft Beer BBQ Deck Party](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ns-craft-beer-bbq-deck-party-tickets-17487247829) on Saturday, July 11th, which will feature a four-course dinner, with each course being paired with a different Nova Scotia beer; check the link for tickets and more details. Keep an eye out early next week for the next iteration of PEI Brewing Co.'s _Vic Park Pale Ale_; this version will feature the wonderful **Nelson Sauvin** hop. Several new beers are on tap at [Paddys Irish Brewpub](http://www.paddyspub.ca/) in the Valley. Drop by for a taste of their _Scotian Tartan Export Sour_, _Porter_,  and_ Lime_ beers. For those of you lucky enough to be near the [Kennebecasis Valley ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=Kennebecasis+Valley), you'll be able to find [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery)'s popular seasonal, _Hawaiian Pale Ale_, on tap for growler fills there next week (July 2-5).
