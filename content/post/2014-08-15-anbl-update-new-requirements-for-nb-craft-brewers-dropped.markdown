In an [announcement](http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2014.08.1065.html) just made this afternoon, [ANBL](http://nbliquor.com/) has removed the new regulation requiring craft breweries to sell at least 100 hL (10,000 L) of beer through ANBL stores before being allowed to sell beer at the brewery for off-site consumption (e.g. growler fills). That regulation, just announced last month (our reports [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/friday-wrap-up-20140718/) and [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/friday-wrap-up-20140725/)), would have been a major hurdle for many of the small breweries that have opened or would be opening in the province.

ANBL CEO Brian Harriman had the following to say: “I am pleased that the board of directors has approved these changes and I look forward to working with all brewers in New Brunswick to promote the craft beer industry. This regulation was put into place to ensure product quality, however, after discovering it may be a barrier to new breweries, it was removed.”

In order to meet these quality demands, all new brewers will be required to send a product sample to an independent food inspection lab and undergo [Smart Serve](https://www.smartserve.ca/) training; both of these requirements will be paid for by the ANBL.

This is fantastic news for NB craft brewers; we're ecstatic to see that ANBL board members have listened to the demands of both brewers and the public. If it wasn't for fans of small and local businesses voicing their concerns, the regulation may never have been re-evaluated so quickly. We look forward to the continued growth of craft beer in New Brunswick, and the rest of Atlantic Canada!
