Good morning, lovers of craft beer! Time to dig yourself out of that snowbank and catch up on a bit of Atlantic Canada Beer news...

• [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) released a new, limited-edition beer yesterday for growler fills at the brewery. Glenora Barrel-Aged Strong Dark Belgian comes in at a hefty 11% ABV; the aging of the beer in the Glenora barrel adds "some vanilla, a greater depth of complexity, and whiskey on the finish", according to owner Peter Burbridge. Only about 170 L of the beer was brewed, so get some now, as it won't last long! Available at their Agricola Street brewery, or at the [Alderney Landing Farmers' Market](http://alderneylanding.com/market/index.html) this weekend.

• [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) has announced their latest seasonal release for winter - their Muddy River Stout, an [Oatmeal Stout](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style13.php#1c), has been available on tap for years at their [brewpub](http://restaurant.pumphousebrewery.ca/) and [Barnyard BBQ](http://barnyardbbq.ca/) locations in Moncton, and in select bars and restaurants in the Maritimes. This full-bodied, dark beer is described by the brewery as having flavors and aromas of "roasty malts, espresso and chocolate", with a "big and lightly acidic finish"; it clocks in at 4.5% ABV. It is currently available in 6-packs at certain [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) locations, and should be reaching all stores soon. For those of you in Nova Scotia, the beer should also be arriving at [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/) stores shortly after Christmas.

• If you're trying to think of what to do for New Year's Eve (yes, it's only a week and a half away), the new and already extremely popular Halifax beer bar [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) has an idea for you! They're holding a "Mortal Sin" event, featuring the highly-rated Quebec brewery [Dieu du Ciel!](http://www.dieuduciel.com/) Cost of entry will be $20, and includes snacks from chef Graeme Ruppel, as well as a 5 oz glass of Dieu du Ciel!'s Bourbon Barrel-Aged Péché Mortel. The event begins at 9 pm, and seating is first-come, first-served. "Formal(ish) dress encouraged".

• If you're closer to the Antigonish area, the [Townhouse Brewpub and Eatery](https://www.facebook.com/AntigonishTownhouse) is hosting their own NYE event, a "Craft Beer and Local Food Celebration". There will be three food courses from chef Jacob Buckley featuring locally-sourced food, and four beers from four of Nova Scotia's newest breweries in 2013: [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/), [Uncle Leo's](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/), [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/), and, of course, the Townhouse. Beer trivia will also be included. It all starts at 6:30 pm; tickets are $60 and can be purchased in advance at the Townhouse. Following the dinner at 9 pm, there will be karaoke and an "open-mic confessional".

• And for the day after, [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) will be holding a [Levée Celebration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev%C3%A9e_(event)#History) from 12-2 on January 1st. Featuring live entertainment and plenty of great beer flowing, they are keeping this tradition alive in their own special way.

• We announced [last month](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/friday-wrap-up-20131108/) that [Red Rover Brewing](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) had their location confirmed, and were receiving lots of equipment and apples to start brewing their first batches of cider. At the time, they had planned on having their retail store open before Christmas so they could start selling merchandise and other swag; however, that opening has been delayed until after Christmas. On the bright side, they have started brewing cider, so we should be seeing their product in the area in the not-too-distant future!

• We also mentioned [last month](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/22/friday-wrap-up-20131122/) that [Les Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) had started looking for two brewers for when they begin producing beer in 2014. This is just a friendly reminder that the application deadline for resumes is this Sunday, December 22nd. The official job posting can be found [here](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/actualites/20-offre-d-emploi-brasseur); if you're considering applying, don't wait any longer! Also, they've confirmed that all their equipment has now been ordered - great to see that they're one step closer to production!

• And one more reminder, if you're still looking for some last-minute Christmas gift ideas, check out the [gift guide](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/atlantic-canadian-beer-blogs-holiday-buyers-guide-2013/) we posted on earlier this week.

That's it for this week; we at the Atlantic Canada Beer Blog hope that you all have a safe, fantastic, happy, beer-filled holiday! Merry Christmas!
