Happy Friday, folks! We are now officially into fall, and as such, we have plenty more autumn and harvest-themed beer news this week.

• [Big Axe Brewery](http://www.bigaxe.ca/) has released their Seasonal Harvest Ale, _Rusty Axe Amber Ale_. Continuing Big Axe's theme of using local ingredients in every beer, the Amber Ale was brewed with brown sugar glazed carrots, roasted squash and their own homemade brittle right in the boil. With these unique ingredients, the flavour and aroma is reminiscent of fall, with hints of vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove, built on top of a soft caramel base. It weighs in at 5.6% ABV and 28 IBUs, and is available at the brewery.

• [Picaroons Brewery](http://www.picaroons.ca/) has brewed up a new beer recently, _Page Turner Session Ale_. The Amber Session beer weighs in at 3.7% ABV, and the recipe features Gooseberries. It was brewed to celebrate the upcoming 60th Anniversary of [Goose Lane Edition](http://www.gooselane.com/), a local publishing house. Proceeds from the sale of the beer will be donated to [Laubach Literacy New Brunswick](http://llnb.ca/). They will be holding a launch event at the [James Joyce Pub](http://www.cpfredericton.com/en/restaurants-dining/james-joyce-irish-pub) on October 3rd to celebrate its release.

• Picaroons has yet another new beer that they are just releasing today. _The Tabulator_ is described by the brewery as "a conservative Extra Special Bitter, that has been dry-hopped quite liberally with an uncountable amount of green hops". It comes in at 5.5% ABV, and will be served almost-exclusively at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf) for growler fills, with the possibility of being available on tap at a couple of bars/restaurants in Fredericton.

• _Indian Beach Harvest Ale_ from [Big Tide Brewpub](http://bigtidebrew.com/) is on tap now! This is one of their Fresh Hop beers, using hops they picked themselves (with help from friends and family) from local winery [Dunhams Run](http://www.dunhamsrun.ca/main.html), on the Kingston Peninsula. The malt base is 2 row and caramunich malts, and the hops used were **Nugget** and **Cascade**. This 4.8% ABV caramel-coloured beer has a fairly light body, with delicate fresh hopped flavors coming through nicely.

• We have some more details on the new beer, _Sub_Stanchel Amber_, brewed by [BarNone](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) a couple of weeks ago. This is a wet-hopped beer, with two varieties of fresh hops added to the boil: an unknown noble variety picked in Stanchel, PEI, and an equal amount of freshly-harvested **Cascade** from the BarNone farm. With more hops added as a dry-hop addition, this should be a fairly aromatic brew! It comes in at 5.5% ABV (exact calculated IBUs are unknown).  Look for it soon at bars/restaurants in Charlottetown, and at the weekly growler night (Thursdays) at the brewery.

• We mentioned the details behind the new collaboration beer between [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) and Beau's - _Sweet Rye'd Harvest Wheat Ale_ - a [couple of weeks ago](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/12/friday-wrap-up-20140912/). Well, that beer - brewed with three different hops and the Bog Myrtle herb - has been released today at the Garrison Brewery. Clocking in at 6% ABV and 40 IBUs, the beer is copper-colored and "ripe with aromas of herb and black pepper, melon and citrus fruit" according to Garrison. It should follow for a limited time only at select NSLC stores, all four private liquor stores in Halifax, and at some of the bars/restaurants in the area.

• Garrison will be taking part in [City Harvest v3](http://www.ilovelocalhfx.ca/v1/) on October 4th, and will be turning it into a **Harvest Launch**, as they will be pouring the _Sweet Rye'd_, as well as their new _Double Jack Imperial Pumpkin Ale_, and their _3 Fields Harvest_. The Double Jack is on the darker side of the spectrum, and weighs in at 8% ABV, and we'll have more details on both beers next week.

• Speaking of City Harvest, [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) will be getting in on the fun by offering discounts on growler fills and merchandise, [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) will be selling Back Door Takeout Mac & Cheese and Cask Beer samples (no word yet on which beers), and [Premier Wines](http://premierwines.ca/store/) will be doing beer tastings.

• [Piez Bistro](http://www.piezbistro.com/) in Dartmouth is hosting **Sociable for ****Prostates** tomorrow, Sept 27th. During the event, you can purchase a tasting paddle of three different local craft beer, along with three paired pizza or other bites, for $10, with $5 of that donated to [Prostate Cancer Canada](http://www.prostatecancer.ca/). They are highlighting local craft beer, and should have a few special beers available. Check out [their flyer](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BwswGi6CMAA_0qE.jpg).

• One of the new beers pouring at the event will be from [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/), with a harvest beer, the first in their _Hants County Hop Series_. Brewed with Maritime Malt, and local hops, this series will highlight the diverse hop varieties available here. Unfortunately, hop and farmer details were not available before publishing time. We can tell you that they've been using a [hopback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing#Hopback) at the brewery to get the most aromatics from the hops. This piece sits between the kettle and the wort chiller, and is filled with hops, so the hot wort will extract lots of aromatic compounds, but then be chilled, dissolving them into the liquid before they can volatilize. As the whole leaf hops used are not as concentrated as pellet hops, they may not have very high bitterness, but the beers will be quite aromatic. They also will look to launch growler sales at the [Wolfville Farmers Market](http://www.wolfvillefarmersmarket.ca/) soon, stay tuned for details.

• [Uncorked Tours](http://www.uncorkednb.com/) will be holding their last beer-tasting cruise for the year on Saturday, October 4th on the Saint John River, from 2:00 - 5:00 pm. Taking place once again on the Mississippi river boat Voyageur II, the cruise will be Oktoberfest-themed, featuring seasonal and Harvest ales from Picaroons, Big Tide, [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery), and [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) (brewery list is subject to change), as well as Oktoberfest fare such as pretzels and sausages. Guests will be entitled to a 9-oz pour of each beer (after a short description), along with a refill of their favorite beer after all have been sampled. In between tastings, guests can socialize, enjoy the scenery, and sample the different foods available. Most breweries will have representatives present to answer questions about their beers. Tickets are $75 + HST, and can be purchased [online](http://www.uncorkednb.com/events--travel.html).

• Tickets for the inaugural trip of [New Brunswick Beer Tours](https://www.facebook.com/newbrunswickbeertours) are now available! We initially reported on the tour last week and it looks like the schedule has been finalized. The all-day bus tour, **River Valley Beer Tour**, will be held Saturday, November 1st, and will include stops at [Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/), [Railcar](http://railcarbrewing.com/), and Big Axe (subject to change), as well as in-trip sampling of ciders from [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/); the tour will wrap up at 6:30 pm with more beer sampling at the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/). Ticket prices have been confirmed at $75 + fee, and are available [online](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/new-brunswick-beer-tours-tickets-13304045759?aff=Fredericton). [Fredericton Tourism](http://www.tourismfredericton.ca/en/) is currently holding an [online contest](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonTourism?v=app_1555862211310575&app_data=gaReferrerOverride%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252F) for two tickets; if you're over nineteen, make sure you enter to win!

• A final reminder that the next [Burgers n' Beer](https://www.facebook.com/events/791728590858386/) event in Fredericton will be held soon, and your chance to buy tickets is almost gone! Originally scheduled for September 30th, the event has been bumped a week to Tuesday, October 7th. Pairing six different sliders with six different beers/ciders, it's held at reLiSH's uptown location. Tickets are almost sold-out; they're $45 each and can be purchased [online](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/burgers-n-beer-fredericton-tickets-12601063119?ref=enivtefor001&invite=NjQ0MDg3MS9zaGF3bm1lZWtAaG90bWFpbC5jb20vMA%3D%3D&utm_source=eb_email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=inviteformalv2&utm_term=attend&ref=enivtefor001).

• Big news from our friends in Newfoundland! The [Beerthief Special Order Beer Club](http://www.beerthief.ca/) are having a custom batch of beer brewed for them by Garrison Brewing. The beer will not be released until January 2015, but it will be available uniquely to the Beerthief members through their normal ordering process. In celebration of this upcoming brew, they are holding a naming and label contest, open to all members, until October 10th. Details, and a template for the label, are available [here](http://www.beerthief.ca/industry-news/special-order-beer-club-label-contest).
