The following is a press release that has [just been added to the Garrison Brewing website](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/accounts/garrison/websites/garrisonbrewing.com/website_files/Press%20release-Garrison%20announces%20Ultimate%20Brew-off%20beer%20style%20for%202013.pdf) regarding the 2013 Brew-Off Challenge:

HALIFAX, N.S. – Dec. 11, 2012 – Once again this winter, Garrison will host the Home Brew-off Challenge, a contest designed to showcase the talents of Maritime homebrewers. This is Garrison’s 5th annual Brew-Off contest in conjunction with urban winery Noble Grape. It's the only annual Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) event in the Maritimes.

This year’s style to brew is a Belgian Blonde Ale: moderate strength golden ale with subtle Belgian complexity, slightly sweet flavour, and dry finish.

The winning entry in 2012 was submitted by Lunenberg native Kellye Robertson. Her winning brew, Citra and the Rye, a bold and hoppy take on a medium-bodied ale brewed with rye malt, will be released at the gala in March 2013 and be available for purchase at the brewery and select private stores.
