A tip of the hat to [Canadian Beer News](http://www.canadianbeernews.com/2011/12/16/report-on-small-business-profiles-12-canadian-craft-breweries/) for posting about the [article](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-managing/leadership/12-craft-brewers-shaking-up-the-industry/article2263636/).   The list of Craft Breweries profiled includes Yellowbelly from St. John's, Garrison Brewing Company from Halifax and Charlottetown's Gahan House Brewery.

The article includes some interesting stats about how Atlantic Canada's beer consumption is different from the rest of Canada and the significant growth of microbreweries.  Check out the article to find out which brewery has had sales grow by 25% this past year, which one is in the process of tripling capacity and which one is located in a building that is approximately 170 years old.
