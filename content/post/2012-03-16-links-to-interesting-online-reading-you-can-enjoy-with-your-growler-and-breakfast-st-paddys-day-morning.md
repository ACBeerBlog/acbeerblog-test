[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/shamrock.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/shamrock.jpg)With St. Patrick's day coming up tomorrow it is apparent that this is the busiest time of year for beer related articles:



	
  * Learn how St. Paddy's day is enjoyed [on the Emerald Isle](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/travel/destinations/travel-europe/europe-other-destinations/st-patricks-day-in-ireland-without-a-green-beer-in-sight/article2369406/).__

	
  * Another [article regarding Bridge Brewing Company Ltd](http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/74044-new-microbrewery-coming-north-end-halifax).  There is additional information about the planned bottle size (660ml), two additional planned brew styles (Belgian blonde and a Farmhouse Ale) and anticipated volume in year one of production (approximately 800 cases of beer).

	
  * From the Globe & Mail, [16 steps to throw the best beer tasting party](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/trends/trends-features/16-steps-to-help-you-throw-the-best-beer-tasting-party/article2369159/) (there are also some other interesting links on the web page).

	
  * [The surprising health benefits of beer](http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/03/15/surprising-health-benefits-beer/) (unfortunately your growler with bacon and eggs isn't encouraged).

	
  * Have a cat?  Want to see its head on a bottle of Picaroons?  Then enter [this contest](http://www.picaroonspub.com/profiles/blogs/cat-contest).

	
  * An article about how craft beer is [now more common in the kitchen](http://www.northjersey.com/food_dining/142739085_Move_over__wine____craft_beers_are_making_their_way_into_recipes.html?c=y&page=1) along with a few recipes.
