So it's spring, eh? Ya right! March came in like a lion, and while it may have taken a nap mid-way, it leaves just as powerful. Let's hope those April showers wash away the snow and ice, and we can be done with the white stuff for a few months. The poor weather hasn't kept the brewers down, however, as we've got lots of news from around the horn to share with you today. Without further ado, here we go!


• The results of the first [Gahan Harbourfront](http://halifax.gahan.ca) Homebrew competition are in and the winner is none other than **Ian Wheatley**, who you may remember from his mini-takeover at [Tidehouse Brewing](http://facebook.com/tidehousebrewingcompany/) earlier this month. According to Gahan brewmaster Kyle Jeppeson, Ian’s Trappist Single was exceptional, well-carbonated and featuring a very pleasant yeast and hop profile. Ian will be brewing a batch of his beer on the 5 bbl system at Gahan at some point to be sold alongside Kyle’s offerings. Congratulations are also in order to **Justin Clarke** of the [Brathair Brewing](https://twitter.com/BrathairBrewing) collective, who placed second. Gahan is promising that the competition will be back next year and Kyle is looking for any suggestions this year’s participants might have towards improving it for next year.

• Travelling up the hill to the base of the Citadel, [2 Crows Brewing](https://www.2crowsbrewing.com/) is putting yet another new beer on this week. At 6.8% ABV and 39 IBU, _Shakedown Brett Porter_ marries the classic English style (perhaps the brownest of the brown ales) with earthiness and funk from _Brettanomyces bruxellensis_ yeast and a decidedly New World nose. Dry-hopped with earthy and fruity **Calypso** and straight-up orange grove **Citra**, it’s described by brewmaster Jeremy Taylor as “super earthy, dry, almost mossy in flavour, with a decent layer of funk.” This one wasn’t a big batch, so it’s not likely to be around for a long time. Catch it while you can at the brewery.

• Meanwhile, if you’ve been wondering if maybe there’s been a bit of a method to the madness of all these recent releases from 2 Crows, wonder no more! **Thursday, April 13**, will see 2 Crows doing their [first tap takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/183891668784561/) at [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) in Dartmouth. Promising 10+ taps (although we’ve heard rumours that it could be as many as 14 in total), you’re sure to see your favourite 2 Crows brews alongside some of the interesting limited releases we’ve seen in the last few weeks. And if that’s not enough, knowing Jeremy, there’s sure to be a couple of brand new and interesting brews that will see their first light of day at the event. Plan to kick off your Easter Weekend 2 Crows x Battery Park style. Look for the full tap list to be revealed as the event approaches.

• A hop, skip, and a jump back into the heart of downtown will take you to [Tidehouse Brewing](http://facebook.com/tidehousebrewingcompany/) on Salter Street at Barrington, who are also releasing a new beer today. _Out Like a Lion_ Hoppy Wheat Ale is a 5.1% ABV Ale, brewed with a blend of Superior Pale, and Wheat malts, for a hazy, straw appearance, and lighter body. Lots of late additions of Centennial and Summit (during the post-boil chilling step, as well as dry hopping), give citrus flavours and aromas, which meld nicely with the banana notes from the yeast blend chosen. Grab a growler at the brewery today, and keep an eye on the board of a North End taproom tomorrow to grab a pint.

• The crew at [Trider's Craft Beer](http://www.triderscraftbeer.ca/) in Amherst have been quite busy, with a pair of new beers out, and a couple more in the pipeline for release soon. Making its debut as last month's Craft Beer Cottage Party, _Maccan Maple_ is now available to everyone, no plaid required! Rather than using water as the base liquid for the beer, they only used sap from [Hidden Mountain Maple Farms](https://www.facebook.com/Hidden-Mountain-Maple-Farms-730925713691419/) in nearby Springhill! After mashing and boiling as usual, they added maple syrup to the wort as they pitched the yeast. The 5.0% ABV beer ends up with a strong maple flavour, and is sweeter than other beers of the same style on the market, making this a perfect dessert beer. The beer is freshly bottled, available at their brewery, as well as in growler fills. Kegs of this, and all of their beer, are also available, so keep an eye out at local watering holes for a tap.

• The second new beer from Trider's is _Brew-Deau_ Cream Ale, based on their very popular _Christmas Cream_ seasonal, but tweaked the recipe to end up with a lighter appearance, thanks in part to the subbing in of corn, iconic in a Cream Ale grain bill. The 5.0% ABV beer is lightly hopped to 10 IBU, and will be a popular warm weather beer (if it ever arrives!). You can sip on a bit of summer now, however, as the beer is available in growler fills and 500ml stubbies at their Anson Ave location in the Industrial Park.

• There are a pair of other seasonals headed your way from Amherst, including _White Ogre_, a hybrid between Belgian Witbier and American IPA. What started as a test batch to satisfy co-owner Scott Parker's want of a hoppier beer has proven quite popular with customers dropping by the brewery. A significant wheat base, with lots of orange peel and coriander added, but with a hoppy kick from **Citra**, **Columbus**, and **Willamette**, resulting in a 5.5% ABV, 56 IBU White IPA. The beer is finishing now, and will be available in growler fills and bottles next week. And aiming for late April is _Second Breakfast_ Oatmeal Stout, a 5% roasty dark stout with a creamy mouthfeel thanks to the addition of oatmeal during the brewing. We'll have more details, including release date, later next month. Plus we'll have more news to share on Trider's plans at their current location.

• [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) has released the last batch of _Good Aura_ Amber Ale for the season, as they transition to their summer lineup. Featuring lots of **Mosaic** hops for a stonefruit and tropical aroma, built upon the base of Munich, Caramel, and Ryle malts. Named after brewery rescue dog Aura, part of the proceeds are being donated to the [Fredericton SPCA](http://frederictonspca.ca/). Don't forget that the brewery is dog-friendly to friendly dogs (and people!) and they have treats and water to keep them happy while their owners enjoy human treats. Look for the latest batch of their house IPA, _Hu Jon Hops_, which just dropped at the brewery as well, and will be making it out to the ANBL.

• [Mama's Brew Pub](http://www.mamaspubwesthills.com/) in Fredericton has a pair of new beers on tap these days: _German Dunkel_ is a 4.5% ABV tart, refreshing, beer with a sour fruitiniess and dry finish. Their _East Coast Pale Ale _is replacing their _East Coast Dry Hop _American Pale Ale, with a change of recipe to provide more flavour and body to the base beer, with using loads of late- and dry-hop additions of **Cascade** and **Citra** for pine and citrus aroma and taste. At 4.8% ABV, you can certainly enjoy a session at Mama's!

• In Rothesay, [Foghorn Brewing](http://www.drinkfoghorn.ca/) has released _Bob's Your Uncle_, a 6.5% ABV English IPA, coming in at a significant 65 IBU, with even more hops added after the fermentation, namely iconic English hops **Fuggles** and **Goldings**, as well as new kid on the block **Jester**. Currently only available on tap for pints and growler fills at the brewery on Clark Road, look for it to pop up around the area soon.

• Moncton's [Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) is holding another **Growler Day** today, with three beers available to takeaway: _Killington IPA _is a 7.6% ABV hazy, North East IPA, featuring citrus and tropical notes from the **Citra** and **Mosaic** added throughout the brew. _Method IPA_ is 7.0% juicy IPA as well, but in a different flavour and aroma profile than _Killington_. And finally _Peach Shake_ is a Milkshake-style IPA, featuring lactose (milk sugar) and vanilla beans added to the beer for a sweeter flavour profile, enhanced by the addition of peaches during the brew session.

• [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) will be releasing a new Beta Brew this Sunday called _Brewster Juice_. The name, we expect, is a nod to the millennia-long tradition of female brewers, and this beer was brewed on International Womens’ Day by **Kelly Costello** and two Good Robot Glee Club members, **Jenn** and **Allana**. This is a SMaSH (Single Malt and Single Hop) brew containing nothing but water, Canadian 2-row malt, **Glacier** hops from Fundy, yeast, and a “dry hop” of fresh raspberries. It weighs in at a nice and light 4.2% ABV and has an apricot-gold color.

• Up on the North Shore of NS, [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) has a new release for us this week from their Staff Series of beers. Tata cellarman **Alex Martin** developed the concept for a Brown IPA that melds the chocolate and dark fruit flavors of darker malts with big hop flavors and a solid IPA bitterness. Arriving at a husky 7.1% ABV and 80 IBU, the _Tweed Wolf_ was hopped with the dank, piney and citrus-laden **Simcoe **and the fruity melon and berry subtlety of **Huell Melon**. The _de rigeur_ IPA dry hop contains those same two varieties along with the very tropical **El Dorado** that should bolster an already heady nose. Expect this one to strike a nice balance between rich malts, firm bitterness and fruity hops. Cans will be available as of today at the brewery and should arrive at the private liquor stores next Thursday. Meanwhile, you'll find it coming up soon at tap accounts in Halifax.

• Scuttlebutt in beer circles this week centered around a [posting](http://discussions.probrewer.com/showthread.php?65927-Craft-Brewery-in-Nova-Scotia-Canada-for-sale) on commercial brewing forum ProBrewer regarding a currently operating Nova Scotia brewery being up for sale. Details are minimal and nobody involved is talking openly, which means that speculation is running rampant about who it is and why it they might be selling. With the Craft Beer industry in Nova Scotia growing as quickly as it has, especially over the last five years or so, one of the areas where we're possibly a little behind the curve is in brewery turnover. As we look at some of the other markets where there has been a craft beer boom, however, we see that this is one of the hallmarks of a healthy industry. There are lots of reasons a brewery might go up for sale and many (some might argue most) of them don't have anything to do with beer. While we certainly aren't immune from kibitzing about it ourselves, as local beer lovers and fans of the scene we're mostly interested to see who steps up to buy this business and how they approach taking it forward into its next evolution as a brewery. And no, we don't know who it is either.

Be sure to check out our [Events Calendar](http://acbeerblog.ca/calendar-of-events/), as we keep it as up-to-date as we can with all of the goings on in our region. Remember that we don't always repeat events we've mentioned in previous weeks, so your best bet is to check it periodically, or better yet, add it to your own iCal/gCal, and never miss out! Just click the **+GoogleCalendar** button on the bottom right of the calendar.

• Last week we told you about the 80/- Scottish-style _Collaboration Ale_ created by the various members of the Craft Brewers Association of Nova Scotia. **Today** is your chance to check out that contentious brew as it goes on tap for the [first time](https://facebook.com/events/423732398007759) at **noon** in the [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) taproom in North End Halifax. The first 48 patrons will receive a takeaway can of the beer, which will eventually be available in limited supply at [Bishop’s Cellar](https://bishopscellar.com/store/craft-brewer-s-association-of-nova-scotia-collaboration-ale.html), [Harvest Wine & Spirits](http://www.harvestwines.ca/product/6022/Craft-Brewers-Collaboration/), and [the NSLC](https://www.mynslc.com/en/products/Beer/Ale/Specialty%20Ale/1025119.aspx). You’ll also be amongst the first to hear the first official events list for the upcoming [Nova Scotia Craft Beer Week](http://nscraftbeer.ca/craftbeerweek/), ask questions of Nova Scotia brewers, and try a custom Scottish Hot Dog from [T DOGS](https://www.facebook.com/TDOGSHFX/).

• For some beer excitement in PEI, look no further than Charlottetown's [HopYard Beer Bar](http://hopyard.ca/) **today**. They are hosting a [BarNone](http://barnone.beer/) Tap Takeover, with eight beer from Rose Valley flowing, plus some special beers as chosen by owner and brewer Don Campbell, including Unfiltered's _Fist of God_ IPA. Drop by from noon to enjoy some blasts from the past, as well as new releases. It also corresponds to the first day of [PEI Burger Love](http://peiburgerlove.ca/), the cross-province month of more than 80 establishments (including HopYard) serving up some creative burgers, from PEI-raised beef.

• **Today** is also a big day in Alma, New Brunswick, as the [Buddha Bear Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/buddhabearcafe/) continues their major renovations towards opening Holy Whale Brewing Company in late spring. Located in a former church on Main Street, the Cafe has been open for several months, serving up their own roasted coffee, as well as beer from around the Maritimes. Buddha Bear/Holy Whale owners, brothers Jeff and Peter Grandy, will be closing the cafe during weekdays, and re-opening full-time in a few months. So, what's happening today at the Cafe? The brothers need your help to Drink the Church Dry! All day today, they are looking to push as many kegs as possible through their nine lines, to help make room in the beer fridge. Every time a keg kicks, they will be lowering the price of a pint by 50 cents, so it pays to stick around and enjoy the return on your investment.

• **Tomorrow** is the HRM celebration of [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/)'s 4th Anniversary, and the launch of the 2017 edition of _Ra Ra Rasputin_, with several variations of the Barrel-aged Russian Imperial Stout pouring from 11:30am at [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/), and noon at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/). Look for non-barrel-aged versions (in keg and on nitro), 2016 vintage, plus several unique casks with fruit, coffee, and/or wood additions right in the firkin for an extra level of flavour. You may need to hit both locations for the full experience! Check out the [event flyer here](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing/photos/a.419741884750853.96806.417791361612572/1370560276335671/?type=3&theater).

• Sunday **April 2nd**, is the BC Tap Takeover at Stillwell, postponed from the original March 25th date due to shipping delays. Enjoy a dozen beauties from [Brassneck Brewery](http://brassneck.ca/) in Vancouver, [Dageraad](http://dageraadbrewing.com/) of Burnaby, and [Four Winds Brewing](http://fourwindsbrewing.ca/) from Delta. Featuring a wide variety in styles of beer, including Brassneck’s _Stockholm Syndrome_ Saison, _Sri Lanka_ Dubbel from Dageraad, and Four Winds' _Nectarous_ Dry-hopped Sour. No tickets required for the event, and the doors open at noon (unusual for a Sunday). The full taplist is [available here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BR323vXBRec/).

• Also coming up at Good Robot is [Latin@ Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/1475025752517493), a celebration of Latin American Culture on **Thursday, April 6** that will feature the release of _Cerveza Latina_, a Beta Brew in the Vienna Lager style that was created in collaboration with some of GR’s patrons from various South and Central American countries. It’s got a bready nose, lemony citrus on the palate, and a clean, crisp lager finish. The night also promises to feature broken Spanish, South American-influenced dishes from Black Sheep, a playlist designed to inspire dancing and the Mexican beer cocktails known as [micheladas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelada).

• Digby's [Roof Hound Brewery](http://roofhound.ca/) is celebrating [National Beer Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Beer_Day_(United_States)) on **April 7th**. Only the 7th, how strange, we figured any/every day was a great day to drink beer! But who are we to argue? They will be showing off their expanded tap selection, including a very limited edition of _Big Brown Pure Maple_. Only one keg will be served at Roof Hound,  so best to not miss the event that evening. Live music from [Tide & Timbre](https://www.facebook.com/tideandtimbre/) will kick off the festivities at 9pm, plus they will have guest taps from their neighbour breweries [Lazy Bear](http://www.lazybearbrewing.ca) in Smiths Cove, and [Lunn's Mill](https://lunnsmill.beer/) from Lawrencetown. Check out the FB [Events Page](https://www.facebook.com/events/2260096534210271/) for more details.

**Before we let you go, a couple more things...**

- As the grand opening of their new digs in Windsor approaches, [Schoolhouse Brewing](http://schoolhousebrewery.ca/) is now preparing their "First Draughts" on the new system! We'll certainly have more information as it becomes available, but for now we can tell you that Cam and Co. are looking for a Retail Manager to help run the new storefront operation. The details are at the bottom of their [webpage](http://schoolhousebrewery.ca/).
- [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is bringing back a big 'un today as part of their Cellar Series, the _Barrel Aged Ol' Fog Burner_ barleywine. Weighing in at an hefty 11.5% ABV, it spent time in oak barrels from Glen Breton Rare Single Malt Whiskey from Glenora Distillery. It's available in 650ml bottles costing $15.95 at the brewery and quantities are severely limited.
- [Picaroons'](http://picaroons.ca/) _Winter Warmer_ is done for the year, but they have just released a batch of it that has been aged on French Oak for two months. Available only on tap at their Roundhouse and Brewtique locations in Fredericton, General Store in Uptown Saint John, and The 5 Kings Brewhouse in St. Stephen.
- [YellowBelly](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St. John's has brought back their _East Coast Cream Ale_, a 5.0% ABV, 22 IBU beer brewed in collaboration/celebration of [Top Shed Brewery](http://topshed.com/) on Australia's East Coast. Featuring **Pacific Gem** and **Mosaic** hops from Australia, the beer is on tap at the brewery now, and in bottles to take away.

As a last mention this week, maybe be a little wary of any wild or unexpected claims made by local bars and breweries tomorrow...check your calendar before jumping to conclusions; we wouldn't want anyone to worry about breaking a nail.
