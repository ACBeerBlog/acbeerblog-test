[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/picaroons506.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/picaroons506.jpg)As per the [Picaroons Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/picaroons), the newest brew they have added to their portfolio is 506 Logger.  The brew is described as:


<blockquote>Brewed in Fredericton, New Brunswick (a far cry away from Cologne, Germany), this crisp, LIGHT and refreshing ale is by most definitions a "KÃ¶lsch".
Golden in color, and modestly hopped with traditional German hops; this well balanced nectar rings in at about 4.5% ABV. A great companion to a sunny summer day in the '506' if you ask us...</blockquote>


For the non-New Brunswickers reading this, 506 is N.B.'s area code.

There is also a note on the page saying that it is available while supplies last at the Brewtique in growlers... for now.  Here's hoping that's a sign it'll be popping up in 500ml bottles in the near future.
