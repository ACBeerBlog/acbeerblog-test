[Uncorked Tours](http://www.uncorkednb.com/index.html), based in Saint John, New Brunswick, normally offers winery tours and tastings in the province. On July 20th, however, they're switching things up a bit, and moving into the world of craft beer! That Saturday, they will be hosting a casual [beer-tasting river cruise](http://www.uncorkednb.com/events.html). The tasting will take place on  the Voyageur II, an authentic Mississippi river boat, which will embark from the Saint John Marina at 1:30 pm. So far, confirmed participating breweries include [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co/301456876447), [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons), [Pump House](http://www.pumphousebrewery.ca/), and [Shiretown](https://www.facebook.com/shiretown), with the possibility of one or two more being added soon.

Once the 3-hour tour commences, a bell will ring and the first beer will be introduced by Gilliane Nadeau of Uncorked Tours; guests can then get their samples at the bar.  After 20 minutes, the next beer will be introduced, and so on. Guests are free to explore the ship, enjoy the scenery, and hang out with their friends. Each guest is guaranteed 9 oz pours of  five different beers; additional drinks can also be purchased at the bar throughout the cruise. There will also be an assortment of snacks available. Representatives of each brewery will be on-board to chat about their beers and answer questions from the guests.

Tickets for the tasting are 75$, and can be purchased either by phone at 506-324-4644, by leaving your info on the ["Contact"](http://www.uncorkednb.com/contact.html) page at the Uncorked Tours website, or directly online through [Paypal](50a222a57771920b6a3d7b606239e4d529b525e0b7e69bf0224adecfb0124e9b61f737ba21b081988da7a3c03e3ee25661350b6a36dba24a). There's only a couple of weeks left, and tickets are going fast, so don't wait to get yours!
