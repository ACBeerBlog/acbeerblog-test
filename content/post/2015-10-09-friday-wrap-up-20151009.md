Happy long weekend! Once again, plenty of beer news to share, including the opening of yet another brewery in Nova Scotia in the near future. Let's dive right in...

• There is another new brewery coming to our region in the near future. Nine Locks Brewery will be opening near Lake Micmac in Dartmouth, NS in the next couple of months. It is a collaboration between Shaun O'Hearn (owner of [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/)) and business partner Danny O'Hearn, with current Rockbottom head brewer Jake Saunders moving into the Brewmaster role across the bridge, and former [Brutopia](http://brutopia.net/) Brewmaster Chris Downey joining the team. Nine Locks will be focusing on American and English style beers, launching with an IPA and ESB, with more to follow shortly. Their beer will be available in cans and growlers at their storefront at [219 Waverley Rd](https://www.google.com/maps/place/219+Waverley+Rd,+Dartmouth,+NS+B2X,+Canada), through the NSLC and private stores, and on tap at local bars and restaurants. Their 20 BBL/24hl [DME](http://www.dmebrewing.ca/) brewhouse is being delivered next week, with launch expected late November/early December. Their website and social media pages will be launched shortly, and we'll be sure to keep you up to date with their progress.

• Speaking of new breweries, [FirkinStein](https://www.facebook.com/FirkinStein-Brewing-754150891380564) are expanding their growler delivery program, and will be attending this weekend's [Hubbards Barn Farmers' Market](http://hubbardsbarn.org/farmers-market/). From 8am-12pm (if the beer isn't sold out earlier!), their _Nor’easter Ale_ will be available to purchase in 0.95 & 1.89l growlers, along with their new branded glassware. They will be at the market for the next few weeks, until it closes for the season. And remember that their Bridgewater-area growler delivery service is available a few nights per week, contact them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FirkinStein-Brewing-754150891380564/timeline/) or [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/Firkin_Stein) to get on board!

• [YellowBelly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St John's has brought back their popular _Deep South IPA_ for a second go 'round. This New Zealand-, Australian- and American-inspired IPA features **Pacific Gem** hops from New Zealand and **Mosaic** hops from Australia for tropical fruit, grapefruit, and mint flavours and aromas. Like the previous batch, the _Deep South_ was fermented with an American ale yeast (instead of their house British strain), to allow the hops to shine through even more. The IPA weighs in at 6.0% ABV and roughly 60 IBUs, and is available now on tap, and in take-away bottles shortly.

• [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) has re-released their popular _Chantelope_, an all-_Brettanomyces_-fermented "wild ale". First making its [debut](http://acbeerblog.ca/2014/08/08/friday-wrap-up-20140808/) in August of 2014, this is the first batch that has been brewed since the brewery opened at their current location on [Bishop Drive](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grimross+Brewing/@45.9409484,-66.6755169,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4ca418a206012f43:0xc064780c5bff8803) in Fredericton early this year. While the first brew was fermented with _Brettanomyces bruxellensis_, owner/brewer Stephen Dixon decided to try a different strain for this current batch: _Brettanomyces brux. var. Drie_, an isolate from the excellent Belgian brewery, [Drie Fonteinen](http://www.3fonteinen.be/). Dixon says that the new _Chantelope_ is "extremely fruity and flowery", with lots of pineapple, tropical fruit, and candy-like aromas and flavours, along with a "jasmine-like" character. This light-coloured ale comes in at a lower-ABV (5.4%) than before, with about 23 IBUs. It's available now at the brewery taproom for pours and growler fills, and at select Grimross accounts in the province. And just this morning, they've just released another batch of their _Dubbel_, back again after a few week hiatus. Look for the beer details [here](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/08/21/friday-wrap-up-20150821/).

• Attention PEI beer lovers! There'll be a new beer dropping today at 6pm. Literally! [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) is releasing their fall seasonal, _Gravedigger Imperial Pumpkin Ale_ today, and are starting it off with a bang. They'll be dropping a 200kg local pumpkin from 20 metres to make a big splash/splat, to kick-off the release. Before crying foul, they are using the opportunity to kick off a food drive in their tap room, where anyone bringing in a non-perishable food item will enjoy staff-priced pints until Oct 31st. So, what about the beer? It is years in the making, and was first brewed on a homebrew scale by Brewmaster Mike Hogan, along with local homebrewer Ryan Palmer a couple of years ago. The recipe uses a big malt bill, for a solid base to support the pumpkin pie character throughout. The beer weighs in at 7.5% ABV and about 30 IBUs. And while at the brewery, check out the beautiful [screen-printed posters](https://www.facebook.com/UpstreetCraftBrewing/photos/a.353822721485615.1073741829.325970250937529/441463179388235/?type=3&theater) from Upstreet label artist [Jud Haynes](http://www.judhaynes.com/), each one numbered and signed by the artist. And keep an eye on their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UpstreetCraftBrewing?fref=ts) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/UpstreetBrewing) feeds for more details on other upcoming events, including [Yoga at the Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/events/1500739810252864/) tomorrow, a [fundraiser for Anderson House](https://www.facebook.com/events/545549362258913/) next Saturday, and their first [Comedy Show](https://www.facebook.com/events/1636272236636933/), featuring [Gavin Stephens](http://www.gavinstephens.ca/), on Monday, October 19.

• Shediac's [Flying Boats Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710), which has been operating for the last few months, has just seen a major expansion with the arrival of their 2 BBL/2.4 hectolitre system from [Stout Tanks and Kettles](https://conical-fermenter.com/). With a hot liquor tank, mash tun, boil kettle, brite tank, and four fermentation vessels, this will allow owner/brewer Marc Melanson to brew significantly more beer than previously able on his original, 10 gallon system. Several small-scale batches will be brewed at first to dial-in the new brewery, with full-size brews to follow shortly afterwards to meet "growing demand", and supply new accounts who have been eagerly waiting to pour Flying Boats beer!

• Nyanza'a [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) will be releasing their annual pumpkin beer next week. _Smokin' Jack It_ features the addition of several home farm-grown pumpkins, apple wood smoked right at the brewery. After fermentation, the beer was aged on rum-soaked cardamom, vanilla and cinnamon. It comes in at 5.5% ABV; look for it on tap at the brewery mid-week, and at better beer bars shortly thereafter. Don't forget to drop by today starting at 11:30 for some food from [Cruisin' Cuisine Food Truck](https://www.facebook.com/ccft2015), with music by Maxim Cormier at 2pm. In fact, every afternoon from Oct 9-17 (except Sunday the 11th) at 2pm, there will be live music as part of the [Celtic Colours](http://www.celtic-colours.com/) festival. Check their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1660232580886210/) for the exact schedule. And Big Spruce also has an exciting program in the works with the folks at [Escarpment Laboratories](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/) in Ontario, look for details on that in the coming months.

• Fredericton's [James Joyce Irish Pub](https://www.facebook.com/FoodatTheCrownDowntown) has announced the launch of their "Meet your Makers", an ongoing series of tap takeovers. An opportunity to try several brews from one brewery, each will also provide a chance to chat with the brewer(s) in a quiet setting and ask them questions on their process, ingredients, future plans, etc. A brewery-related food special will also be available at each event. First up is [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery) on [Friday, October 23rd](https://www.facebook.com/events/939778942761221/). Starting at 7:30 pm, owners Peter and Tatiana Cole will be bringing at least six of their beers. Details on exactly which beers are not yet known, but they HAVE brewed up something special for this event, featuring the honey produced on the rooftop of the Crowne Plaza. Their latest re-release of the _Wrath of Putin_ "Imperial Pale Ale" (out today) should be appearing as well. There's no cost to attend, just show up and pay by the beer! Big Axe merchandise will be on hand for purchase.

• And while on the topic, the [next Meet Your Makers](https://www.facebook.com/events/522947027871023/) has already been planned for Thursday, November 5th, to coincide with [Guy Fawkes Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night). Featuring [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/), expect plenty of cider on tap (including one or two new releases), with a good chance of a cask cider as well. A Guy Fawkes effigy will hang out in the pub until 10:30 pm, when it will be taken outside and burned in a bonfire (don't worry, they have a permit!). More details to come.

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has a few new beers available now. Their _3 Fields Harvest Ale _is out, brewed with fresh hops from [Meander River Farm](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/), [Ross Farm Museum](https://rossfarm.novascotia.ca/), and [Wyskmykal Farm](http://wysmykalfarm.ca/), added to the brew within hours of harvest. The beer weighs in at a hefty 6.4% ABV. On tap at the brewery only, they have brewed up a special cask of _Cranapple Weisse_, a cranberry- and apple-infused wheat beer, 5.0% ABV. For those in New Brunswick, look for their _American Red_ on tap at the four [ANBL growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) filling stations. This blend of their _Irish Red_ and _India Pala Ale_ brings together the best of both worlds. Look out for a second batch of their _Double Jack Imperial Pumpkin Ale_ to be refilling shelves at the brewery, NSLC, and beyond. Finally, _Modem Hoperandi_, celebrating [The Stanfields](http://www.thestanfields.ca/)' new album release, is also out now at the brewery.

• The 2nd Annual [ACBAs](https://www.facebook.com/BeerAwardsAtlantic) are back, and tickets are now available to purchase for the Awards Gala at the [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/). On Sunday, October 18th, the winners will be announced and the celebrations can begin! The Goat's Chef Tyler Smith will be preparing a multi-course dinner, each course paired with a local beer. Tickets are [available online](http://shop.thechronicleherald.ca/Atlantic-Canadian-Beer-Awards-Ticket_p_6561.html) now.

• Early Bird tickets for the Local Connection Halifax's [Craft Beer & Local Food Celebration](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/536/the-third-annual-craft-beer-local-food-celebration) are moving quickly, so be sure to snap them up soon to avoid disappointment. The Jan 16 event is moving to a larger venue, which means more room for more breweries, restaurants, and attendees. It always features several special casks and special brews, including Big Spruce's [Home Brew Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/815036745283070/) winner (btw homebrewers, just under two months to go until judging, so best get your brew on now!).

• The [Nook and Cranny](http://thenookandcranny.ca/) has released a _Pumpkin Spiced Ale_, which is now on tap at the brewpub. Brewed along the lines of a Wheat Ale, a pumpkin spiced tea (featuring cinnamon, ginger, and pumpkin spices) was steeped and added to the beer. Served with a sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg rim, it weighs in at 4.5% ABV. Drop down to try a pint before it's gone for the season!

Have a fantastic Thanksgiving! Remember, lots of beer styles pair perfectly with turkey. If you're in the Moncton area tonight, remember that the [Atlantic Canadian Craft Beer Oktoberfest](https://www.facebook.com/events/937201213007684/) starts at 7:30 pm (6:30 for VIP); [tickets are still available](https://atlanticcraftoktoberfest.eventbrite.ca/).

Finally, a few housekeeping notes to end this week's post: we have added a [Growler](http://acbeerblog.ca/growlers/) page to our site this week. We wanted to take stock of all locations in our region selling growlers, and their different filling/return policies. Please let us know if you find a mistake. Also this week, our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ACBeerBlog) was "upgraded", which meant we lost the ability to Friend people. Please don't take it personally! Our [Atlantic Canada Beer Pages list](https://www.facebook.com/lists/10100694815876159) had to be rebuilt from scratch, so if we've missed anything important, please let us know too. Cheers!
