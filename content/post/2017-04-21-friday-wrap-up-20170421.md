Another week of wild weather in our region, with snow and recording-breaking cold throughout the Maritimes, and a wayward iceberg in Ferryland, Newfoundland. Rest assured warmer weather is on its way, so put off going outside a little longer by reading today's beer news...

• After launching a few months ago with two flagship beers, [Think Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/thinkbrewing) (located in Harvey, New Brunswick) has a new brew circulating at their tap accounts in the province. _150 Red IP-eh_ is, as you've probably guessed, a Red IPA brewed in celebration of Canada's 150th birthday. With the goal of being "balanced and drinkable" with a bit of roast flavour, this reddish-coloured ale was hopped with **Amarillo**, **Citra** and **Columbus** (with the focus on Citra), providing some citrus and tropical notes to complement. Weighing in at 6% ABV and 53 IBUs, you should be able to find it on tap at the [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/theJamesJoycePubFredericton/), [Isaac's Way](http://isaacsway.ca/), and [Hilltop](http://thehilltop.ca/) in Fredericton, as well as [Lemongrass](http://lemongrasssaintjohn.com/) and [Cask & Kettle](https://www.facebook.com/caskandkettle/) in Saint John.

• Today, [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) will be releasing their latest collaboration brew, _Mon Cerise_. Brewed with Halifax's own [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca), [North](http://www.northbrewing.ca/), and [Spindrift](http://spindriftbrewing.com/), this "Cherry Belgian Lager" is made up of 2-row, Munich, and Crystal malt, and was hopped with **Brewers Gold** to just 12 IBUs. Aged on sour cherries, the beer is reddish-amber in colour, and has a "slightly tart, mellow cherry aroma, with a  sweet maltiness", according to Garrison. Effervescent, clean, and crisp, it weighs in at 5.4% ABV and will be available on draft only, at Garrison, Good Robot, Spindrift, and [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/).

• In Fredericton, [Mama's Brewpub](http://www.mamaspubwesthills.com/) has re-released their _Great White Ale_, a crowd favourite of the brewery's attempt to perfect the Belgian Witbier style. With a grist comprised of 2-row and Wheat malt, as well as a touch of Crystal malt thrown in for color and flavour, the beer is lightly hopped with **Perle** to 16 IBUs. Plenty of fresh orange zest and ground coriander was added towards the end of the boil; as well, this batch had a new addition - 11 lbs of lactose powder, also at the end of the boil. Brewer Ryan Kingston says the lactose was added to provide a "smooth, silky sweetness" that elevates this batch above others in the past. At 4.3% ABV, this easy-drinking beer is selling fast; it's still available at the brewpub for pints and crowlers.

• Also in Fredericton, [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) released a new cider yesterday, _Blossom_. This 7% ABV, semi-dry cider was created in collaboration with [Flourish Fest](https://www.flourish-fest.com/), a Fredericton-based music and art festival running from April 20th-23rd. Featuring additions of hibiscus, coconut, pineapple, mango, and lemon, you can definitely expect some interesting flavour experiences with this one! Developed as an exclusive for festival venues (including the Cider House and Capital Complex), it will also be appearing on tap at [Graystone](http://graystonebrewing.com/), as well as Halifax's [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/), in the near future.


• [2 Crows](http://2crowsbrewing.com/) released a special brewery-taproom-only beer yesterday afternoon, sure to kick soon if you're not careful. _Crosswired_ is a straw-coloured, 5.3% ABV and 27 IBU hazy brew, with a grain bill featuring pilsner malt, along with malted oats and wheat. **Columbus** was used for first wort hopping, with late- and dry-additions of **Citra** and **Hallertau Blanc**, lending serious citrus, fruity, and floral aromatics. The real fun comes from the yeasts used to ferment the beer, as a hybrid of beer and wine yeasts were employed to get the job done: [Sacch Trois](http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-bank/wlp644-saccharomyces-bruxellensis-trois) and [Lalvin 71B (Narbonne)](http://www.scottlab.com/product-31.aspx). Sacch Trois is a _Sacchromyces_ yeast formerly thought to be _Brettanomyces_, based on the acidity and unique funky, mango, and pineapple aromatics that can develop. The classification was corrected after the producer, White Labs, did further genetic testing, and concluded that while the yeast displays many _Brett_-like characteristics, it was in fact _Sacchromyces_. Lalvin 71B is a wine yeast, isolated by the [INRA](http://www.inra.fr/) in Narbonne, France, and is particularly well-suited for use in Pinot Gris, Rosé and Riesling wines, due to its high and long-lasting ester (fruit aroma) production. The resulting beer has plenty of wild "funky" character to it, with light floral and earthy notes as well. Do not wait to try this beer, as the only 20 litre keg of the beer is on now at the taproom, available for enjoying onsite only.






• 2 Crows is also bringing back one of their early launch beers, _Brettango Mango_. This 7.5% ABV, 64 IBU IPA was fermented solely with [Brettanomyces Bruxellensis](http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-bank/wlp650-brettanomyces-bruxellensis), a strain originating from Brussels, Belgium, and classically found in lambics and other "wild" beers. After primary fermentation, mangoes were added to the fermenter, as well as a big blast of **Citra** for more citrus character. The batch size was ramped up from their initial release, but at only 300 litres, it won't be around for too long. Look for the announcement on their social media this weekend, with a Saturday evening/Sunday afternoon most likely.

• Finally in 2C news this week, they have brewed up a beer with [The Barrowdowns](http://www.thebarrowdowns.com/), an alt-folk band from Halifax. The 6.3% ABV American Pale Ale features a load of West Coast hops, including **Centennial**, **Chinook**, **Citra**, **Columbus**, and **Simcoe**, but at a light 43 IBUs. The only way to grab a pint of the beer is at one of The Barrowdowns shows, the first of which is **tomorrow**, at the [Seahorse Tavern](http://theseahorsetavern.ca/). The first 40 people through the door will receive a pint of the beer with their cover charge, and will also have a chance to name the beer. The winner will receive tickets to their **May 19** [Album Release Party](http://www.thebarrowdowns.com/new-events/2017/5/19/halifax-ns), the next time the beer will be available, plus a copy of the album. More details on the tomorrow's lineup are [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/608802449327832/).

• [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) has released their first new beer in a while, _Albert County Maple Ale_. Marketed as a "malty amber ale with a twist", this one features the addition fenugreek seeds and locally-produced dark maple syrup. Coming in at 5.2% ABV and 8 IBUs, the brewery describes it as having a "medium mouthfeel with a smooth, clean finish", with hints of maple. It appears to be available on tap only, so drop by the brewpub in Moncton today to give it a try; it may pop up at select PH accounts as well.

• Digby’s [Roof Hound](http://roofhound.ca/) is bringing out the second entry in their series of Dive Bar Cocktail-inspired beers. Back in March they gave us a preview of summer with their _Mojito Dry-hopped Sour_ and now they’re giving us the other barrel of seasonal longing with the _Fuzzy Navel IPA_. Featuring a tropical burst from the Australian hop variety **Vic Secret** played against fruit flavours from peach purée and pomegranate juice, this is a juicy and hazy IPA in the New England style. With fruit flavours and hops reminiscent of summer, the 6.25% ABV is likely to sneak up on you if you’re not careful. You’ll find it this weekend at the brewery and also in the city for fills at [Bishop’s Cellar](https://bishopscellar.com/) and on tap at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/), [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) and [2 Crows](https://www.2crowsbrewing.com/), with [Stubborn Goat](https://www.stubborngoat.ca/halifax/) expecting to have it next week. A perfect opportunity to give the Fuzzy Navel a try will come **tomorrow night** at Roof Hound’s [Night of Colour](https://www.facebook.com/events/1357970614258801/) event. **The Sounds of Colour** will be entertaining from 9pm - 12am while artist **David Gorman** will do a live painting that is destined to grace the walls at Roof Hound on a permanent basis. Admission is $5.

• And if you’re considering working in the beer or beer-related hospitality industry and you’re local to Digby, NS, Roof Hound might want to talk to you. After less than a year in business, Les and company are more than doubling their brewing production and nearly doubling their seating capacity. They’ll also be bottling their beer in the near future. To make this expansion possible, they’ll be needing to supplement their staff with part time workers (19 years of age or more) to fill positions as Brewery Assistant, Kitchen Assistant, Dishwasher and Beverage Room Server. If you’re interested, hit up the Roof Hound [web page](http://roofhound.ca/) and send a message via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/roofhound/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/roofhound/) or Email.

• In Shelburne, [Boxing Rock](http://boxingrock.ca/) brought out a new beer this week to celebrate the pending launch of [Finest Kind Food](https://www.facebook.com/Finest-Kind-Food-386790558159416/), a new mobile food trailer set to take up regular residence at the brewery this summer. **Sheila Bird**, who has been making bread from Boxing Rock’s spent grain for several years, will be officially opening the window of her mobile trailer for business on [Open Brewery Day](http://nscraftbeer.ca/events/craft-beer-week-open-brewery-day/), May 6th, featuring a menu of simple, healthy, local and fun food. Food that pairs nicely with Nova Scotia craft beer. Nova Scotia craft beer like the new _Finest Kind Pale Ale_ (note: Finest Kind, two words) brewed as a collaboration with Sheila. At 5.3% ABV and 35 IBU, it sits solidly in the sweet spot for the American Pale Ale style and features biscuity malt from [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) providing a solid counterpoint for a tropical, piney and citrusy blend of new world hops. So give it a try, and look forward to enjoying a few beers accompanied by spent grain pretzels and pizza (and more!) on the Boxing Rock deck this summer.

• Today, [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) is re-releasing their very popular _D'under_, a 5.5% ABV seasonal American Pale Ale brewed with loads of Australian hops. This release will be the first time this beer is available in cans, with a small portion also being kegged for licensees. This first batch was a small one, so be sure to drop by the tasting room to pick up some cans of this tropical beauty! And don't worry, we can expect even more TW beer soon, as they've recently added another 30 BBL (3500 L) fermentor to the brewery.

• [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) has a popular seasonal of their own on the shelves these days, their _Russian Imperial Stout_. This 8.5% ABV roasty, chocolately, full-bodied beer won a Gold medal at the [2016 Canadian Brewing Awards](https://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/winners/2016-winner-list/). As a member of their **Giant Beer** series, this beer is packaged in 650ml bottles, and available now at the brewery. And joining the RIS this week is the latest batch of their _Deadeye_ Double IPA, a 8.0% ABV, 90+ IBU American-style IPA. Featuring lots and lots of **Hallertau Blanc**, **Cascade**, and **Chinook** hops, the yeast has returned to its original american ale strain, after a foray into Vermont territory. This full release means the beer is available for growler fills at the brewery (and maybe at some Halifax-based private stores), as well as cans. Look for it to hit the taps at Tata's licensees this weekend. Or, better yet, drop by the brewery **tomorrow** for some sampling, and check out the Tattoo Brew event going on all day. [Rolling Sea Tattooery](http://www.rollingsea.ca/) will be setting up their chair and bringing their ink guns to help people (permanently) declare their love of Tata Beer. Eager clients have snapped up all of the spots, but the possibility of cancellations or quicker-than-anticipated tats means you could still grab one. Check out the options available on the [FB events page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1020549714744434/permalink/1035295549936517/), and drop by 11-6pm to check out the action (and beer!).

• Today at noon marks the return of two favorites from Halifax’s [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/). Striking while the iron is hot after their star-turn (as in, the transcript is full of *’s) this week on the [902 Brewcast](http://www.902brewcast.com/) (Blue-cast?) **Greg Nash** and **Andrew Murphy** made the magic happen to bring back both _Front Line Rocker_ and _Daytimer _Berliner Weisse ahead of schedule. Still the fastest-selling beer in Unfiltered’s history, the Front Line Rocker is a massively juicy and mind-shatteringly hoppy DIPA that comes in at 8% ABV and 100+ IBU. At the other end of the spectrum is the Daytimer, a summer favourite in Haligon for the past couple of years, an extremely light 3.4% ABV brew that pairs a thirst-quenching sourness with a blast of tropical aroma from a healthy **Mosaic** dry-hop. And don’t think for a second that the boys rushed these out the door: listen to the [episode via iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/902-brewcast/id1177839089) for their unvarnished take on several topics, including particularly pertinent words about the importance and value of a brewery’s reputation.

• Halifax's Good Robot has a busy weekend ahead of them. Buoyed by the return of _Whackity Schmackity Brew!_, their American Wheat Beer, and imminent return of _Tom Waits For No One_ Stout (most likely Sunday), there will also be a pair of events (and accompanying releases) in the next couple of days. Tomorrow is a [Day of Beer and Vinyl](https://www.facebook.com/events/1906726692897779/), celebrating [National ](http://www.recordstoreday.com/)(did we ever figure out which nation this is?) [Record Store Day](http://www.recordstoreday.com/). Hitting the taps will be _Mississippi Goddam_, a five-month-old 11.0% ABV Barleywine, which is "dark, rich, vinous, with a super caramel-fruitcake nose", according to the brewery. Hitting the taps Sunday, celebrating the day after Earthy Day, is _Work With Whatcha Got Gruit Earth Day Ale_, made with 100% Horton Ridge Malt (both the summer and winter maltings), Nova Scotia-grown hops (**Centennial** and **Chinook**) from [Fundy Hops](https://www.facebook.com/FundyHops/), with maple sap and maple buds, as well as toasted paper and yellow birch from HRM. Grab this, along with Organic guest taps from Tatamagouche _(Hippie_ Dippie Pale Ale) and Big Spruce (_The Whole 9 Yards_ Scotch Ale) from noon during their [Earth Day Hangover](https://www.facebook.com/events/387031911683975/).

It's a busy weekend ahead for us thirsty beer fans in [#AtlCanBeer](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AtlCanBeer) land!

• The 2 Crows crew are at it again, with a [Tap Takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/1039778929455236/) taking place **tonight** at [The Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/). From 7pm on, look for 10+ 2C beers to be flowing, with special pricing available for flights of their beer, so you can try them all (and then grab a pint of your favourite!). Folks from 2 Crows will be there to chat beer, brewing, this crazy weather we're having, whatever you want! And when you do grab that flight, you'll receive a ballot to win tickets to the next day's [Brewer's Brunch](https://www.facebook.com/events/128166884386388/). Jeremy Taylor of 2 Crows has paired up four of their beer with four dishes from the Goat, for a great hangover cure. The ticketed event runs 1-3pm on **Saturday**, and can be reserved [via email](mailto:tyler@stubborngoat.ca) or in person.

• Those looking for a bit of a different event this weekend may enjoy checking out [Saltscapes East Coast Expo](http://saltscapes.com/expo/) at the Halifax Exhibition Centre. Running **today until Sunday**, the event showcases crafts, destinations, and food and drink made in the Maritimes. There will be ten breweries and distilleries in attendance providing plenty of samples, so at $14.50 (or less with [this coupon](http://digital.saltscapes.com/?shareKey=PlLwm5)), it could be the cheapest inadvertent beer fest you hit up this spring! One great reason to visit will be to help [Sober Island Brewing](http://www.soberislandbrewing.ca/) celebrate their First Anniversary! They will be pouring the _Oyster Stout_, _Bitter_, and launching a new core beer, their _Blonde_, all of which are early batches from their massively-expanded brewhouse. At 5.0% ABV, this "gateway beer" features a twist on the theme, using a dash of Honey Malt in the grain bill, which carries through to a pleasant flavour in the finished beer. Lightly hopped to 20 IBU with **Cascade** and **Mount Hood**, it is sure to be a great summer sipper. In addition to samples of all three beers, visitors can buy crowlers to go, as well as plenty of merch. Happy birthday SIBC!

• The newly-formed [Moncton Craft Brewers Collective](https://www.facebook.com/Moncton-Craft-Brewers-Collective-326374931097523/) is holding a [Tap Takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/1300435530069727/) at [Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) **tomorrow, April 22nd**, all day.

Starting at 4pm, Boxing Rock’s **Emily Tipton** will host a beer tasting that features a sneak peek of their yet-to-be-released _Dark as Keji_ Black IPA that they’re dedicating to Kejimkujik as part of the Canada 150 celebrations. This beer will be officially launched on **May 20** at Keji, with samples at the sky circle there. A portion of the proceeds from each 6-pack sold will be donated to the Friends of Keji to support education programs related to the [Dark Sky Preserve](http://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ns/kejimkujik/activ/Things-to-do-at-Kejimkujik-National-Park-and-National-Historic-Site/reserve-etoile-sky-preserve?=undefined&wbdisable=true). This weekend you’ll be able to get a taste of that and other Boxing Rock brews as Emily gives a virtual brewery tour. After that, and a few words from RASC and Keji about the partnership with Boxing Rock, some RASC volunteers will lead a family-friendly evening program about the night sky and stargazing.

Here are a few more things that have popped up this week:

- [Mill Street St. John's](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) has released _Right Off the Hop_ Double IPA this week, a beer we first mentioned a couple of weeks ago. The 7.5% ABV SMaSH beer features loads of **El Dorado**, to the tune of 68 IBU, and lots of fruity aromatics. Grab a pint or growler today!
- Mahone Bay's [Saltbox Brewing](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) has brought back their Loyalist beer, a 6.7% ABV English-inspired beer, featuring complex malt notes including caramel, coffee, and toffee, with a hint of citrus from the hops. Grab it, plus their other beers (maybe some of their _Jam Session_ Batch 83 Raspberry Pi beer, if it's still around) at the brewery this weekend.
- A reminder of [Stillwell's](http://www.barstillwell.com/) busy weekend, starting with the To Øl Tap Takeover **Saturday**, with 12 taps of Danish Metal pouring from noon. And while tickets for **Sunday's** [tasting with Stephen Beaumont](https://www.facebook.com/events/688635331337061/) are sold out, we have it on good authority that there may be a few leftover goodies to enjoy at its conclusion at 4pm.
- [YellowBelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St. John's has brought back their _Brewis Hard Tack Ale_, made with day-old bread from their neighbours at [Rocket Bakery.](http://rocketfood.ca/) The light-bodied beer is on tap now, and will be available in bottles shortly. Though we do not have confirmation of the exact recipe and breads used, [check out our description of the beer](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/04/22/friday-wrap-up-news-from/) when it was released in April 2016, for an idea of the finished product.
