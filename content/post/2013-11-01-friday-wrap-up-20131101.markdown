Welcome to November! I hope all of last night's tricks were fun, and your treats were Atlantic Canadian Craft Beer.







• [Big Spruce Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) is holding a homebrew competition as part of their contribution to the [Craft Beer and Local Food Celebration](https://craftbeerns.eventbrite.ca/) event, put on by [Local Connections](https://twitter.com/ConnectionsHFX) in January (we'll have a full post on it soon). The full information is available on their [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/678682095490324/), but the important details are: The competition is open to all Nova Scotian homebrewers. The style of beer is an American IPA, [BJCP style 14B](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style14.php#1b), one entry per brewer. Registration of intent closes November 7th, and beers are due at the brewery by December 2nd. Registration is $25, and that includes a Big Spruce t-shirt. The brewer of the winning beer, as chosen by the judging panel, will brew their beer on the 7 barrel system at Big Spruce, and be released at the event in January. So, homebrewers, start your kettles, and be sure to email [Big Spruce](mailto:bigsprucebrewing@gmail.com) to receive and complete the registration form.







• [Celtic Knot Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) has a new beer in the pipeline - an [English Barleywine](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style19.php#1b), "Toque and Mitts" was brewed with Maris Otter, Chocolate Malt, Wheat Malt, and Crystal 120 L. A dark and malty beer coming in at about 7.5% ABV, it has approximately 33 IBUs and is brewed with Willamette, East Kent Golding, and Belma hops. We'll keep you updated as to when this beer is available; it should be out around the beginning of December, available where other Celtic Knot beers can be found, [The Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) and [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/).







• Details for the beers being poured at the [Fredericton Poutine Festival](http://frederictonpoutinefestival.weebly.com/) next weekend are now available on the event's [ticket site](https://fredpoutinefest.eventbrite.ca/). [Grimross Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) will be serving their recently-released Belgian Rye IPA, as well as a new beer, their Belgian Porter (details below). [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) will be pouring their Yippee IPA, Blonde Ale, Winter Warmer, and 104th Regiment. [McAuslan Brewery](http://mcauslan.com/en/) will have their Pale Ale, Apricot Wheat, and Oatmeal Stout, and [McClelland Premium Imports](http://www.mcclellandbeers.ca/) will be bringing Steigl, Erdinger Dunkelweizen, Affligem Blond, and Fruli. Unfortunately, there's no word yet as to what beers [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) will have at the event. There's still some tickets to the festival available; remember, the regular ticket gets your four 4 oz beer samples, while the "Beer Experience" gives you twelve samples.







• Back to Grimross Brewing, their Belgian Porter is just about finished and ready for release. A dark brown beer best thought of as a [Brown Porter](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style12.php#1a) fermented with a Belgian yeast strain, it is described by owner/brewer Stephen Dixon as having a roasted aroma with hints of chocolate and dark candy, and flavours that start with roast and finish with chocolate and syrup. As mentioned, it should be pouring at the Fredericton Poutine Festival, and will likely be available in growlers at the Picaroons Brewtique soon!







• And in even more Grimross news, their beers are starting to make their way to Moncton! The Belgian Rye IPA has recently been available on tap at the Tide & Boar, and has reportedly been selling very well. Dixon has confirmed that this beer will continue to be sold at the T&B for the time-being, so if you're in Moncton and haven't tried it yet, now's your chance! Check out their latest [blog post](http://grimross.com/2013/11/01/growing-pains/) for more thoughts from the Grimross Team.







• Continuing with new-beer news, [Hell Bay Brewing](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) has released their new seasonal beer, Wee Heavy. A [Strong Scotch Ale](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style09.php#1e) brewed with six different malts, it's described by the brewer Mark Baillie as "a slightly sweet, rich and malty beer with caramel flavours and hints of smoke". Coming it at 8% ABV and just under 20 IBUs, it's currently available in bottles at the brewery, and should be arriving at [Premier Wine & Spirits](http://premierwines.ca/store/) in Halifax this weekend.







• [Paddy's Pub](http://www.paddyspub.ca/) in Wolfville has released their newest seasonal beer, S'Mashed Pumpkin Ale. Weighing in at 5.2% ABV, the beer features a bright orange colour and hints of pumpkin pie spice, backed up by clean malt flavours of pilsner, Vienna and crystal malts. Like their Acadian Cream, Raven Scottish Ale, Annapolis Valley Ale and Blueberry Ale, the S'Mashed is also available in growlers at the pub. Unfortunately, their Chimney Swift Stout is not available in growlers, as it is served on nitrogen, and this technique does not fare well in bottles.







• Meanwhile, it looks like the [Gahan House Pub](http://www.gahan.ca/) plans on having a new beer to release soon. Details are extremely slim, but it appears to be brewed with locally-grown hops; where exactly the hops are from, however, remains to be revealed. It appears that the beer has been brewed at the pub, and not at the PEI Brewing Co.







• If you've been itching to get your hands on one of those hand-crafted [Shiretown Beer](http://shiretownbeer.com/) steins, they're available again! This is the third release of the mugs, which are made by Monique (Bujold) Brown of [Barlicoco Pottery](https://www.facebook.com/PoterieBarlicocoPottery). Only 15 were made; at $35 each, they're going fast. They can be purchased at the brewery, or check out their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/shiretown) for availability.







• A reminder that [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is serving up some special beers as part of their [King's Wardroom](https://www.facebook.com/KingsWardroom) Wednesday Firkin events. This week's beer was "Jack'O'Dubbel", a [Belgian Dubbel](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style18.php#1b) style Pumpkin Ale. If you are a King's student, alumni or friend of one, don't miss out on these special one-off releases, tapped promptly at 4:30pm.










• [The Antigonish Townhouse](https://www.facebook.com/AntigonishTownhouse) is catching up with the great demand for their in-house brewed beer, and Terry's Best Bitter is in steady supply these days. The beer is treated like a traditional Real Ale and is cask conditioned and on hand-pump, so best drunk fresh, right at the bar, we figure. :) We've not had a chance to try it yet, but reports are very favourable.







• [Stillwell Beer Bar](https://www.facebook.com/barstillwell) is hiring a couple more people for their soon-to-be-open location. They are looking for both kitchen and front-of-house folks to round out their excellent team. Check their [Kijiji ad](http://halifax.kijiji.ca/c-ViewAd?AdId=538582350) for more details. Number one requirement: must love beer! There's been a ton of work done at Stillwell since our visit [last month](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/stillwell-beer-bar/); we're looking forward to sitting down for a great pint soon!







• Finally this week, tomorrow is [Learn to Homebrew Day](http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/pages/events/learn-to-homebrew-day). Organized by the [American Homebrewers Association](http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/), this event is aimed at new (or soon-to-be-new) homebrewers looking to learn a bit more about their hobby, but all are welcome to take part. Despite its name, the AHA is an international organization, and there are events taking place in Atlantic Canada. Support your local homebrew shop and ask if they'll be putting on an event. If not, why not offer to do one to share the great hobby with your friends and family? Sure, they always appreciate that bottle of homebrew you bring to the party/wedding/wake, wouldn't they like to know how you made it? In Nova Scotia, [Noble Grape](https://www.facebook.com/noblegrapeurbanwinery) is showing off a partial mash brewday at their [Burnside store](http://noblegrape.ca/find-a-store/#burnside) beginning at noon, and the [Brewnosers](http://brewnosers.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=5353) are hosting a full mash brewday in Halifax, beginning at 10am (yes, it does take a bit longer to do a full mash, but the results speak for themselves!). Come on by if you are interested in learning more.







And stay tuned early next week, as we've got a great interview with a couple of members of the [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) regarding the [Cask Event](http://lblcaskfest.eventbrite.ca/) taking place at the [Stubborn Goat Gastropub](https://www.facebook.com/StubbornGoat) November 17th.
