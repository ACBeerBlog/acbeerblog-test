Hello, craft beer fans! As the weather finally starts to improve a little in our region, let's warm up your weekend even more with some beer news...

• [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has released details on their newest brew, a [Biere de Garde](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style16.php#1d); this marks the first time this malty, lagered, French beer style has been brewed by a brewery in Nova Scotia. _La Rive du Sud_ is brewed with base malts and dark caramelized sugar; it clocks in at 7.5% ABV. With "notes of biscuit, caramel, toffee, as well as tangerine, peach, nutmeg, clove and allspice", the beer has a dry finish with a "lingering spicy aftertaste", according to the brewery. Available in 650 mL bottles at the private stores in HRM Saturday, on tap at select bars/restaurants, and in bottles and 1 L growler fills at the brewery, get it while you can! You can read more about this new beer on the Boxing Rock blog, [here](http://www.boxingrock.ca/blog/la-rive-du-sud-biere-de-garde).

• [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) has announced that they're brewing a new beer today, an [Imperial IPA](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style14.php#1c) (aka Double IPA) named _Too Hop to Handle_. Brewer/owner Shane Steeves has confirmed that the beer should come in at about 8.4% ABV and 101 IBUs (calc); all of the flavor and aroma hop additions will incorporate the **Zythos** hop, a hop blend that has been described as strongly aromatic, with "tangerine, lemon, grapefruit, and pine notes". We'll keep you updated on it's release; it should be available sometime next month in the Saint John area.

• Over in PEI, [BarNone Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) has also brewed up a new beer. Details on _Summer Solstice_ are pretty slim, but we do know that the strongly-aromatic **Citra** hop is involved. BarNone recently had a vote on its Facebook page as to whether the beer should be filtered or unfiltered; unfiltered was the strong favorite, so look for the beer to be slightly hazy, but exhibiting more hop aroma and flavor as a result.

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) has announced that they will be having their [Brewer's Bash](https://www.facebook.com/PicaroonsBrewersBash) beer festival again this year, on Saturday, July 12th from 11am - 11pm. Like last year, the event will be held at Officer's Square in downtown Fredericton; ticket prices will remain at $25 each, with 500 more being sold this year. The date of ticket sales has not been determined yet; keep your eyes on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BrewersBash) feed for an announcement next Tuesday. With about 60 breweries and 300 beers featured in last year's sold-out festival, expect at least as many this year. In the meantime, they are looking for volunteers; send them an [email](mailto:volunteer<at>picaroons.ca) if you're interested! We'll post more details on the festival as they become available.

• To celebrate the 1st anniversary of the opening of their new brewery, the [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) is putting on their [1st Annual Taps & Tunes Music Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/635252413229324/). This 4-day festival will take place from Tuesday, May 14th to Saturday, the 17th, and involves multiple bands at multiple venues (including the PEI Brewing Co. and [Gahan House](http://www.gahan.ca/) locations); check out their link for full music details. No details yet on if they're brewing up something special for the festival, but there MAY be a special cask released!

• Speaking of the PEI Brewing Co., this Saturday they will be hosting their fourth [Art Battle](http://artbattle.ca/abd/) (an event that features live competitive painting). For this battle, they plan on releasing a British Pale Ale dry-hopped with whole cone hops... that's all we know for now, but if you're in the area and want to give it a try, drop by for a taste!

• [Red Rover Brewing](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) has added a couple new accounts to their growing list, as their _Spring Brew_ is now available at two new locations. Look for it on tap in Fredericton at [reLiSH Gourmet Burgers](http://relishyou.ca/) at their [uptown location](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Relish+Gourmet+Burgers/@45.93185,-66.6632,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4ca42239e4f2dc59:0x76e0123386814e76), and in Moncton at the [Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/).

• [Rogues Roost](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) has brewed up an exciting new beer, set to hit the taps late next week: a _Dunkel Weizenbock_. Combining the best characteristics of several styles, this 7.5% ABV beer will taste like the chocolate banana split of beer, thanks to the melding of malt, hops and yeast character. It was lightly hopped with **Saaz** and **Hersbrucker**, though these flavours and aromas take a back seat to the rich melanoidins and sour-dough breadiness. We're looking forward to this one!

• [Paddy's Pub](http://www.paddyspub.ca/) in Wolfville is hosting a [Brewery Tour](https://www.facebook.com/PaddysWolfville/photos/gm.1407370289542502/760431157324004/?type=1&theater) this Saturday, May 10th, at 5:30pm. Visitors will be able to learn the art and science behind brewing, by learning about the ingredients that go into your pint, the brewing process, and how to taste the beer. Tickets are $10 (available at the bar), and include a 16oz beer. We are not sure if this will be a regular event, so be sure not to miss it!

• Also on Saturday, Halifax is home to[ Open City](http://www.ilovelocalhfx.ca/v1/), a city-wide event highlighting local beer, food, arts and craft producers. Several beer-centric stops will be on the go, including:
- [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) will be hosting a pop-up by [Getaway Meat Mongers](http://www.getawayfarm.ca/), and are featuring a Test Batch IPA-based mimosa, which will pair well with Getaway's Philly Cheese Steak.
- [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) is hosting a Goat Fest with music and [Oulton's Farm](http://oultonsfarm.ca/) Burger (with [Ran-Cher Acres](http://www.rancheracres.com/) goat paneer, Sriracha slaw & bacon fat mayo).
- [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) is hosting the [Food Wolf](http://www.thefoodwolf.com/) truck for your K-Dog fix, and featuring special pricing on growler fills.
- [The Foggy Goggle](http://thefoggygoggle.ca/) is featuring $5 [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) Pints, and Giant Foggy Spud stuffed with bacon, corn, red onion & cheese.
Check out [I LOVE LOCAL](http://www.ilovelocalhfx.ca/v1/)'s page for the full list, and be sure and get out and experience Open City!

• Speaking of Garrison, they are releasing a new beer today in advance of the [OBEY Convention](http://www.obeyconvention.com/), being held in Halifax May 22-25._ OBEY This Brew_ is a hopped-up Pale Ale, a blend of their _Hop Yard_ and_ Tall Ship Amber_ brews, weighing in at 5.0% ABV and 30 IBUs. It will be sold in 650 ml bombers, available at the brewery, NSLCs, private stores and at hosting licensees during the OBEY Festival.

• Garrison is also one of the breweries taking part in the [Local Connections Wine and Spirits Gala](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/407/wine-and-spirits-gala), taking place next Thursday, May 15, at the Halifax Club. They will be serving an _Elderberry Wheat Ale_, dry-hopped with whole leaf **Simcoe** for a piney, woodsy character melding with the berry aroma. It weighs in at 4.6% and 13 IBU. Joining them in the Craft Brewer's Room are Boxing Rock Brewing, North Brewing, and Propeller Brewing. There are still a handful of [tickets](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/wine-spirits-gala-tickets-9277161239) left, so jump on them now if you'd like to attend. These LC events are always a great time, lots of different flavours and tastes under one roof!

• It was a busy week for new breweries in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley: after [Meander River's](http://meanderriver.ca/) announcement of their [May 17 opening](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/05/07/meander-river-farm-and-brewery/), the soon-to-be-open [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/) was invaded by local brewer [Greg Nash](https://twitter.com/__NASH__), [Beer Tech](http://www.beertech.ca/) owner Ken Greer, and [The Pub Magazine's](http://www.thepubmagazine.com/) Troy Kirkby. They brewed _Principal Ale_, their dry-hopped Pale Ale, and are looking to have this on tap in early June. Stay tuned here in the next little while for a full profile on Cam Hartley and the Schoolhouse Brewery!

• Chris had a chance to drop by the [Heron's Nest Cottages & Bistro Pub](http://www.heronsnestcottages.com/) in Charlo for a food and beer tasting last night. Derek Leslie of [Shiretown Beer](http://shiretownbeer.com/) lead the tasting of 9 different New Brunswick beer, including Shiretown's _Blonde du Quai_, _Big Brown Ale_ (used to cook meat balls), _Honey Wheat_ (made with local Charlo honey, and used in the cooking of a ham), and _Siren's_ T'Ale (chicken thighs were roasted in this beer). Also featured were three offerings from [Big Axe Brewery](http://www.bigaxe.ca/) in Nackawic: _Chanterelle Cream Ale_, _Maple Wheat Amber Ale_, and their _Double Bit IPA_. The Bistro Pub always has Shiretown beer on tap, and an excellent stock of beer from around our region and around the world, and is definitely worth visiting when in the area.

And, don't forget... it's Mother's Day this Sunday! Thank a Mother near you with some tasty craft beer!
