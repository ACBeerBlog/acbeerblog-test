I received the following press release today about the latest offering from Garrison (can't wait to try it!):

**Garrison releases much anticipated second 15th anniversary beer **

HALIFAX, N.S. – December 5, 2012– This Friday, Garrison Brewing will launch "**15th Anniversary Malt, Vanilla & Cocoa**". This is the much anticipated second of two special release beers by one of Halifax's original microbreweries celebrating 15 years in business.

"Hitting 15 years is a real milestone in business and we're truly grateful for such strong local support," says company president Brian Titus. "_15th Anniversary Malt_ is intensely rich, complex, dark, roasty, bittersweet... you get the point. It's all been leading to this!"

"We followed the concept of our spring _15 Hops_ brew, using 15 separate malts, two unmalted grains, bundles of vanilla beans & bags of raw cocoa husk," explains Daniel Girard, Garrison’s Brewmaster. "The result is an Imperial Stout of epic proportions with a dark, sweet character and lingering velvety texture. Enjoy!”

"**15th Anniversary Malt, Vanilla & Cocoa**" is 9.0% alc/vol with moderate to high bitterness. It's packaged in 500ml single-serve bottles and officially goes on sale Friday, December 7, at the brewery store and all four private stores (while supplies last).
