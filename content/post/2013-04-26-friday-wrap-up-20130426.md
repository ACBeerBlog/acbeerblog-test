Hello beer buddies! It's another Friday, so another Friday Wrap-Up:



	
  * [Shiretown Beer](http://www.facebook.com/shiretown), located in Charlo, NB, should have their flagship beer, Blonde du Quai, for sale in 500 mL bottles at select [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) stores by the end of next week. A Blonde Ale with more hops than typical, Blonde du Quai recently won a bronze medal at the[ Saint John Beer Festival](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest) on April 13th. Look for it at ANBL locations in Campbellton, Charlo, and Dalhousie, and on tap around the province. Here's the direct "[Find it](http://www.nbliquor.com/location.html?upc=400000024493+&submit.x=25&submit.y=10)" link.

	
  * [Railcar Brewing Company](http://railcarbrewing.com/), which will be opening by the end of 2013 in the Florenceville-Bristol area, has added an [online store](http://railcarbrewing.com/shop/) to their website. Currently, hats, men's and women's t-shirts, and women's hoodies are available for purchase, with glassware being added soon.

	
  * The [Antigonish Townhouse](https://www.facebook.com/AntigonishTownhouse) has been open since July 2012, and have now started brewing test batches on their [SABCO Brew Magic](https://brewmagic.com/) system. We're excited to hear about another brewpub "opening", and with the success the restaurant is already having, think the locals will enjoy their in-house beer. Stay tuned as we do a profile on them in the coming weeks.

	
  * [Garrison Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/garrisonbrewing) have done a special release of their 15 Malt Anniversary beer, aged for three months in [Glenora Distillery](http://www.glenoradistillery.com/) Barrels. This is only available at the brewery, and is very limited, sorry!

	
  * The [Saltscapes Expo](http://www.saltscapes.com/expo/) is on this weekend at the Halifax Exhibition Park. Not beer-centric per se, but lots of breweries will be in attendance: [Propeller Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/propellerbeer), [Garrison Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/garrisonbrewing), [Ironworks Distillery](http://www.ironworksdistillery.com), [PEI Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/peibrewingcompany), [Prince Edward Distillery](http://www.princeedwarddistillery.com/).

	
  * And congratulations once again to [Big Spruce](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing)! We attended their HRM Launch Party at the Wooden Monkey Dartmouth, and sampled both their Kitchen Party Pale Ale and Cereal Killer Stout. While we didn't kick as many kegs at the Sydney party (I blame the poor weather), the beer, food and music was great! Their beer is now on tap in Halifax ([Wooden Monkey](https://www.facebook.com/TheWoodenMonkey) [Dartmouth], [The Argyle Grill and Bar](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Argyle-Bar-Grill/199482733395691) [Halifax], [Gabrieau's Bistro](http://www.gabrieaus.com/) [Antigonish], [Bras D'Or Yacht Club](http://www.brasdoryachtclub.ca/) [Baddeck], [Governor's Pub and Eatery](https://www.facebook.com/GovernorsPub) [Sydney], [East Side Mario's](https://www.facebook.com/esmsydney) [Sydney]).
