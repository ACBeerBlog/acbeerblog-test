Happy long-weekend Friday, everyone! After several weeks absolutely chock-full of beer news, it looks like things have slowed down - **slightly** - as everyone gets ready for Thanksgiving...

• The long wait is almost over... [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) should be supplying beer to the thirsty public very soon! They've hired their first full-time assistant brewer, and their first commercial brew day will occur this weekend - they'll be brewing up a batch of their _Artisan Brown Ale_, a traditional English Brown with an ABV of 5% and 22 IBUs. For every growler of this beer that is sold, Railcar will donate $0.50 to the [Andrew and Laura McCain Art Gallery](http://mccainartgallery.com/) to support art programs for youth in the community. Their _Railcar Red_ (5% ABV, 23 IBUs) will be brewed several days later; look for their beers to be available for growler fills at the brewery soon, and hitting local restaurants/pubs on tap. They're also expanding into a space behind the brewery, where they'll be opening a spin-off company named **Brew Offs**, where they'll be selling products made with beer ingredients - e.g. spent grain granola, beer soap, beer barbecue sauce, etc. - to avoid wastage as much as possible.

• Railcar will be at the NB Nano Takeover at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) (with their _Railcar Red_), being held next Saturday, October 18th. During the two sessions (12-3, 4-7), some of the smallest and most innovative breweries in New Brunswick will be pouring their beers and ciders, most for the first time outside of NB. [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301), [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery), [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307), [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery), [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/), and [Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) will also be pouring that day. [Tickets are still available](mailto:tix(at)barstillwell.com) for either session, and your $15 entry will snag you a t-shirt and your first pour. If you haven't booked them by now, you *may* not get the correct sized t-shirt (be sure to specify in your request), but at least you'll get in the door! And you definitely don't want to miss out on this very special day.

• [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) will be holding their Second Annual Home Brew Competition shortly, so NS homebrewers, fire up your kettles! This year's style is [6D - American Wheat or Rye](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style06.php#1d). Full registration details will open very shortly, however we can tell you that entries will be due November 26th, and the judging will take place November 29th. Once again, the winning brewer will be invited to step up their homebrew recipe on Big Spruce's 7 bbl system, and the beer will be launched at the Local Connections [Halifax Craft Beer and Local Food Celebration](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/482/craft-beer-and-local-food-celebration-2015), January 15, at the Halifax Club. With over 6 weeks of lead time, we can look forward to some great beers being submitted (maybe even a chance for a test brew to fine tune the recipe?). As in last year's, entry is open to all NS homebrewers, and please [email Big Spruce](mailto:bigsprucebrewing(at)gmail.com) for the registration form.

• Speaking of Big Spruce, they have two new beers in the pipeline; the first one is _Das Sprucebier_, an Oktoberfest (aka Märzen) brewed with 100% imported German malt, including Vienna, Pilsner, Munich I, and CaraMunich. It clocks in at 5.9% ABV and 23 IBUs, and is hopped with both **Magnum** and **Challenger**, the latter of which is grown on-site at the Big Spruce farm. The second beer, _Smoking Jack_, is their first seasonal Pumpkin ale. Featuring their own farm-grown, organic pumpkins that have been smoked for 5 hours outside the brewery  and added to the mash, the beer was then conditioned on cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg... that had been soaked for 72 hours in [Flor de Caña](http://www.flordecana.com/) Centenario dark rum. And, of course, the rum itself was then added to the beer for good measure! This one weighs in at 5.4% ABV and 22 IBUs. _Das Sprucebier_ is available now, and the _Smoking Jack_ will be released just in time for the [Celtic Oktoberfest](http://celticoktoberfest.ca/), being held October 25th in Port Hawkesbury, NS (more on that later in the post). Both beers will be available for growler fills at the brewery, and at select bars/restaurants in the Halifax area as well.

• The [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) is holding their annual [Oktoberfest](https://www.facebook.com/events/294848530709199/) celebration next weekend on Saturday, October 18th. Like last year, the event will be held throughout the day, with an artisan market, music, and lots of sausages and beer for purchase. Included in the beer offerings is a new cask brewed for the occasion: _Big Jimmy Brown_ is their _Iron Bridge Brown Ale _aged on bourbon-soaked oak chips, "primed" with Creme de Cacao; it clocks in at 6% ABV and ~30 IBUs. Their popular Growler Challenge (where contestants compete to see who can hold a full growler of beer at arm's length for the longest period) begins at 2:00 pm, and later in the evening, starting at 8:00 pm, their first Art Battle of the season will be held. This will be followed by live music starting at 10:30 pm, featuring [Rich Aucoin](https://www.facebook.com/richaucoinmusic) and [PS I Love You](https://www.facebook.com/psiloveyouband). Entry is free during the afternoon; tickets for the Art Battle and after party are $10 and can be purchased [online](https://www.festivalticketing.com/boxoffice/?cref=05ca5953-6755-46a4-9b57-5b69b4c02f6a).

• And while on the topic of the PEI Brewing Co., their popular _Sydney Street Stout_ is now back in liquor stores across the Maritimes, and on tap at select locations.

• [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has just brewed a new beer, an Amber Ale fall seasonal hopped with "a very special hop, believed to be unobtainable". They're keeping details under wraps for now, but we'll have more info for you next week! For now, look forward to a beer featuring a hop that "really makes it a special brew", according to owner/brewer Emily Tipton. They hope to have the beer released before the end of this month. And we see that they are brewing up another batch of _U-889_ today, which is their ACBA Gold-Medal winning Russian Imperial Stout.

• [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/) recently brewed a revised batch of their _Siren's T'ale_; this one was brewed with a new hop variety, **Goldings**, from [Southan Farms](http://www.southanfarms.net/). Owner/brewer Derek Leslie has confirmed that this variety may become a permanent substitute in future brews of this particular beer. In the meantime, when the beer becomes available, if you'd like to try it to compare to previous batches, look for bottles with batch #146 indicated on the label.

• We have some more details on the [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) _Winter Saison_. Their popular _Saison_ will now be a year-round beer (weighing in at 5.5% ABV), however the orange and coriander from the _Summer_ brew is being swapped out for _Winter's_ ginger and black pepper. We had a chance to try it on the weekend, and quite enjoyed it!

• [Sea Level Brewing](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) has released their latest seasonal,  _Punkin Grinner Ale_. Brewed for the first time [last year](http://acbeerblog.ca/2013/10/25/friday-wrap-up-20131025/), this beer features local produce, including baby pam pie pumpkins grown on the Sea Level farm. It weighs in at 5% ABV, and features local honey and Annapolis Valley hops. We can also confirm that it's available now at the Port Pub and brewery, and will be in the Halifax Private Stores this weekend.

• A reminder that the [Beerthief Special Brew Label Contest](http://www.beerthief.ca/industry-news/special-order-beer-club-label-contest) closes today. Be sure to send your entry along to [Mike](mailto:mike(at)beerthief.ca) to be entered. [Garrison Brewing's](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) special brew will be released in January, to Beerthief members in Newfoundland and Labrador only.

• Toot toot! Final call for [East Coast Beer Tour's Valley Tour](http://eastcoastbeertours.com/products/annapolis-valley-tour)! Check out their bus tour to the Annapolis Valley, scheduled for tomorrow, October 11th. Tickets are now only $25, and include transport, three brewery tours complete with beer tastings, snacks and lunch. Now's your chance to visit [Meander River](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/), [Paddys Irish Brewpub](http://www.paddyspub.ca/), and [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/), and leave the driving to someone else!


• The latest [Local Connections Halifax](http://localconnections.ca/) Magazine is on its way to the printers, but the digital version is now available for reading. In it, there is an extensive [Craft Beer section](http://issuu.com/connectionshfx/docs/localconnections11/39?e=6833877/9653112), featuring Garrison Brewing, Propeller Brewing, Schoolhouse, the Atlantic Canada Beer Awards, and much more.







• Tickets are still available for this month's [Celtic Oktoberfest](http://celticoktoberfest.ca/), being held in Port Hawkesbury on Saturday, Oct 25th. A nice write-up in the [Chronicle Herald](http://thechronicleherald.ca/community/cape-breton/1240505-strait-chamber-launches-first-annual-local-food-beer-celebration) highlights many of the local food and beer vendors whose products will be offered that evening. Remember that your ticket includes beer AND food, as well as great local entertainment. And be sure to check out the [Pumpkin Launch](https://www.facebook.com/events/699336286807411/) that afternoon on the Port Hawkesbury marina. If you've got a team of like-minded designers and builders, sign up to take part!







• [Barley, Hops and Mash](https://barleyhopsmash.splashthat.com/), a workshop for Craft Brewers, is taking place October 24th at Acadia University in Wolfville. The brainchild of [Springboard Atlantic](http://springboardatlantic.ca/), it seeks to pair brewers with scientific researchers, for mutual benefit. Perhaps a brewery has a question about hops utilization in their system, a lab or research group is available with the tools to perform the experiments and analyze the results. Gary McMullen (President and Founder of [Muskoka Brewery](http://www.muskokabrewery.com/)) and Joel Alex (Founder and President of [Blue Ox Malt House](http://www.blueoxmalthouse.com/)) will give Keynote talks, and then brewers and researchers will give short 3 minute/1 slide presentations on their research needs and abilities, respectively. The seminar is free, and is aimed at established or in-development breweries.







• What a weekend! Chris was thrilled to have been one of the organizers for the inaugural [Atlantic Canadian Beer Awards](https://www.facebook.com/BeerAwardsAtlantic) held last weekend. Saturday was a long day of judging, with the 18 judges tackling over 170 different beers, submitted by 28 different breweries. The hard working stewards kept the beer moving and the judges busy, going quite late into the night. Once the dust settled, the results were tallied, and announced at the [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/), Sunday evening.




Here are the results, and we offer our sincere congratulations to all entrants. What a great celebration of our brewing community!

* Brewery and Brewpub of the year were determined by the number of points earned by four pre-assigned beers (as chosen by the brewery). Both categories were hotly contested!
