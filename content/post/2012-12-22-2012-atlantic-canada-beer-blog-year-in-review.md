Before going into full blown holiday mode, I wanted to do up a post looking back at the profiles that I've done over the year. Here's the list of everyone I want to thank for taking the time to contribute to content on this blog (for anyone I may have missed, I apologize, I will no doubt think of you 30 seconds after I click "Publish"):



	
  * Derek Leslie from Shiretown brewery for being the guinea pig for [my first profile of a brewery](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/the-story-of-shiretown-beer-dalhousie-n-b/).

	
  * The PEI Beer Guy for passing along tips for a new blogger and for taking the time for a [Q & A with me](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/looking-for-great-beer-tasting-notes-check-out-the-pei-beer-guy/).

	
  * The Garrison Brewing crew for answering questions over email [for a profile from early in the year](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/the-story-of-garrison-brewing-co-halifax-ns/) and specifically for [Brian Titus for taking the time to meet with me in June for an interview](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/q-and-a-with-garrison-brewing-co-president-brian-titus/).  Garrison has been great in keeping me in the loop for press releases related to Garrison and the Seaport Beerfest (thanks Katie!).  While I've been fortunate to have the cooperation of many breweries in Atlantic Canada, Garrison Brewing wins the award for "Most Atlantic Canada Beer Blog Friendly Brewery".

	
  * Taylor McAuslan for taking the time for a brewery tour and interview for [a profile of McAuslan Brewery](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/the-story-of-mcauslan-brewery-montreal-quebec/).  No, they're not Atlantic Canadian but they are a great brewery!

	
  * Chris McDonald to taking the time to answer questions for [a profile of the Brewnosers](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/profile-of-brewnosers/),  for letting me join the Brewnosers for one of their meetings in June at his place and for letting me sample some of his home brew.  Chris and his brewing partner Brian make a wicked Wit and Creme Brule Stout and are a big inspiration as to why I've started all grain brewing myself.  Chris has also answered many home brewing related questions for me "offline".

	
  * The Living Legend of the Atlantic Canada Beer scene, Greg Nash, for taking the time to complete a [Q & A with me over email](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/q-a-with-atlantic-canadas-rock-star-brewer-greg-nash/).  Also for treating me to a few of his outstanding beers in June at Rockbottom when he shared some of his war stories.  The man could write a book about his experiences brewing just about everywhere in the Maritimes.

	
  * Patrice Godin from Acadie-Broue for taking the time to do [a profile for the blog](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/09/the-story-of-acadie-broue-moncton-n-b/) and for sharing some of his vast beer knowledge over a beer on a few occasions.  In my mind, he, Nash and Daniel Girard from Garrison Brewing Company are the three most creative brewers in Atlantic Canada.

	
  * "Raven and Sierra" for taking the time to do [a guest post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/friday-the-firkinteenth-at-the-grey-lodge-pub-philadelphia-pennsylvania/) for the blog and much more importantly, bringing an amazing selection of craft beer for an unforgettable beer tasting in June.  Between "Raven" and Patrice who joined us for most of that fateful night, I learned an unbelievable amount about beer (and an idea of how much I have yet to learn).

	
  * Tico and Jaf, a couple of guys from Montreal who met with me for a few beers and the chance to discuss the [Montreal beer scene](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/insiders-guide-to-the-montreal-craft-beer-scene/).  Thanks again to "Raven" for introducing me to Tico.

	
  * The guys from Darkside Brewing for taking the time to [do a Q & A over email](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/q-and-a-with-the-guys-from-darkside-brewing/).

	
  * Shawn Meek for taking the time to answer questions over email to do a[ Q & A with him](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/q-and-a-with-the-man-behind-meek-brewing-co/).  On a personal note, Shawn has answered a ton of questions over email to regarding home brewing.  My first batch brewed was a [personal recommendation for me](http://meekbrewingco.blogspot.ca/2012/06/tastingrecipe-donovan-red-20.html) and am going with recommendations from him for my 2nd and 3rd batches.  I've been fortunate enough to sample a few of his brews and they are excellent.

	
  * Dennis Goodwin from Picaroons for answering a series of questions over email including information for [a profile of Picaroons](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/the-story-of-picaroons-traditional-ales-northampton-brewing-company-fredericton-n-b/).  I also wanted to mention that I have heard many stories from multiple breweries first hand (I'm sure there are others) about how helpful Picaroons has been in helping new breweries start up and on-going support (Stephen Dixon is actually brewing at their site).  Sean and the folks at Picaroons take the "brotherhood of craft brewing" to the next level.

	
  * Andrew Cooper from Propeller for answering questions over email and for setting up [an interview with company president John Allen for me](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/the-story-of-propeller-brewing-company-halifax-n-s/).

	
  * Shaun Fraser from Pump House Brewery for taking the time for an [interview for a profile for the blog](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/14/the-story-of-pump-house-brewery-moncton-n-b/) and for Alina for answering questions over email about Pump House news.

	
  * Dave Evans, a.k.a Beer Maven, for taking the time to answer questions over email for a [Q & A about his blog](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/q-and-a-with-beer-blogger-beer-maven/).

	
  * Peter Burbridge from the soon to be open Bridge Brewing Co. for taking the time to [answer questions over email for a Q & A](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/q-a-with-peter-burbridge-from-bridge-brewing-company/) and then [doing it again](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/follow-up-q-and-a-with-peter-burbridge-from-bridge-brewing-company/).  It's very exciting to see a new brewery focusing on a more Belgian flavour and with a zero-emissions goal.

	
  * Mike Ferguson for taking the time to write [the Story of Ruddy's Brewpub](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/the-story-of-rudders-brewpub-yarmouth-n-s/).

	
  * Jeremy White for taking the time to do a [Q & A related to his new brewery, Big Spruce Brewing](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/31/q-and-a-with-jeremy-white-from-big-spruce-brewing/).

	
  * Stephen Dixon for doing a Q & A for [his new brewery, Grimross Brewing](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/02/q-and-a-with-stephen-dixon-from-grimross-brewing-co/).

	
  * Mark Baillie for taking the time to do a[ Q & A for Hell Bay Brewing](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/q-and-a-with-mark-baillie-from-hell-bay-brewing-co/).

	
  * Chris Conway for doing a [Q & A related to Newfoundland Beer History](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/22/q-and-a-with-newfoundland-beer-historian-chris-conway/).

	
  * Richard Bennett for doing a Q & A related to the [New Brunswick Craft Brewers Association](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/26/profile-of-the-new-brunswick-craft-brewers-association/).

	
  * Mike Buhler for doing a [Q & A regarding his Newfoundland Beer Purchasing Club](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/profile-of-beerthief-newfoundland-artisanal-beer-club/).


Very BIG changes are going to be taking place on this blog in the near future.   Stay tuned.
