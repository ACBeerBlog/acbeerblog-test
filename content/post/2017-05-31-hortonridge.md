The [Horton Ridge Malt & Grain Company](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) opened in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley in 2016, the first commercial malt house in Atlantic Canada. Owner Alan Stewart has been farming and running [Stewart's Organics](https://www.stewartsorganicfarm.com/) for more than 30 years. Malting Organically-grown grains from their own fields, as well as other farms, their variety of malts and adjuncts have found buyers across the Maritimes. On Thursday, June 1, they are opening a small brewery and taproom at the Malt House, to showcase their malts in beers brewed onsite, as well as by their customers. Six taps have been installed, three of which will feature Horton Ridge brews. For the other three, Organic stalwarts [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) and [Big Spruce Brewing](http://bigspruce.ca/) will have dedicated taps, and the final spout will rotate through beers from other breweries that use Horton Ridge malts. We caught up with Alan to ask him some questions about how they decided to start brewing, their initial offerings and plans for the future.

**Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
**I am sixth generation farmer in Hortonville, with the oldest certified organic farm in the Province. I ran away from the farm after high school to get several engineering degrees, but beat it back to Hortonville upon graduation.

**How did you get into the world of beer?
**We came into the beer business by way of its most important ingredient, malt. We opened Atlantic Canada's first craft malt house a year ago.

**What made you decide to take the step into opening a brewery?
**Malting always made sense to me, it is a farming maneuver; we are harnessing the natural processes that occur during the germination of the seed. I did not know much about brewing, but what I did find out after a while that our malt was significantly different from macro malt that the craft brewing industry depends on. Recipe substitution was not the answer, replacing industrialized macro malt with floor malt is like replacing industrialized enriched white flour with stone ground whole wheat flour. We wanted to be part of the process whereby recipes were developed around our malts. It also did not hurt that we have a highly visible location next to Highway 101 in Nova Scotia's bread basket with a quickly developing culinary scene.

**What is the culture of the brewery?
**Our brewery tag line is "From Grain to Glass", we will be making beers from malts made on-site. We consider ourselves a malt house first, and a brewery second. Our goal is to highlight the role of agriculture in brewing by showcasing the growing and malting of grains. Another important aspect of what we do is to increase the economic footprint of brewing by allowing brewers to replace imported malts by those made here. In the fullness of time, the economics will get even better as we develop our malting grains growing capabilities. We have been able to access regionally grown grains (mostly from PEI) more quickly than we had anticipated, very happy for that. Since we have been farming organically for so long, we did not hesitate to have the organic philosophy extend to our malting and brewing operations. In our opinion we are providing the opportunity for brewers to extend their "craft" value chain. There is a cultural discontinuity of a "craft" brewing industry that relies on industrialized macro malt.

**Can you tell us about the beers you plan on offering initially? Any seasonals or one-offs in the works?**
We have two beers nailed down. The first is _Malt House Ale_, it is made of equal parts of our Two Row, Vienna & Munich malts. It is hopped with **Summit**. It is intentionally malty with a pronounced bready finish. The second is _Rye's Up Local_, made from 50% PEI barley, 25% PEI wheat & 25% of rye that we grew ourselves. We would like to round out the pan Atlantic aspect of this beer by accessing a suitable hop from New Brunswick. We have recently started malting oats from PEI, so we are working on an Oatmeal beer. We have a good working relationship with our neighbour [Just Us! Coffee](https://justuscoffee.com/), so you can look for beers finished on coffee, tea and chocolate.

**Where will people be able to enjoy your beer?**
We will be selling our beers out of our taproom only. We will sell them in flights, pints & growlers & bottles.

**Do you have some initial accounts in the area lined up to serve your beers?
**We have absolutely no plans to sell our beers outside of our taproom, with the possible exception of winter growler sales at the Wolfville Farmers Market (where I was a vendor for 23 years). We purposely undersized our brewery to leave room to bring in beers that our brewery customers make with our malts. At least half of our taps will be those beers. All of the beers served out of our taproom will be based on our malts.

**Have you had any assistance from breweries in Atlantic Canada?**
We did not want to get drawn into the "beer style" thingy right off the bat, we wanted to let the beers end up where our malts took them. To that end we employed the DIY approach. We certainly appreciate the support from our largest malt customers, [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) and [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/).

**Where do you hope to see your brewery in the next 2-3 years?
** At the moment we have no plans to scale up, we want to continue to highlight malt forward beers to our taproom patrons and malt customers, and to provide an outlet for the beers made by our customers.

**Switching gears to the brewing system, what type of system will you be brewing on, and what is your expected output?
**We have a 120 litre system from [Stout Tanks & Kettles](https://conical-fermenter.com/), brewing 3-4 times per week during the summer.

**Can you tell us about who will be running the brewhouse?**
Our brewer Stephen Mastrioanni has been brewing for 2 years, and has been brewing with our malts from day one. He has a good handle on the malt.

**Do you have a favorite beer style, beer, or brewery you enjoy drinking?
**I do happen to like malty beers, have gotten over hops. My "go to" brewery is [Sea Level](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/), it is close by, and I appreciate Randy's support along the way. I also look forward to the offerings of Tata & Big Spruce that we bring back after making deliveries there.

**How about favourite style or ingredient to brew with?
**Of course, for us, it's all about the malt.

_Thanks to Alan for answering our questions and sharing the details on the new brewery and taproom! Current plans are to have the taproom open 7 days a week from 11am to 8pm. Bar snacks will be available, including pickled eggs "powered by" free range hens who are fed a malt-based chicken feed sourced from Horton Ridge. They'll also be offering 1 liter growler fills (Horton Ridge beers only) - they're happy to sell you one or you can bring your own (clean!) one to be filled. So if you're in the area or planning a trip that way,__ be sure to drop by [2504 Ridge Rd](https://goo.gl/maps/DASuCBaZvH42) in Wolfville (the Malt House is visible from Exit 10 on the 101), and keep your eyes peeled to their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hortonridgemalt), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/HortonRidge) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hortonridge/) pages for the latest news and events._
