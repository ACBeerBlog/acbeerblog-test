Welcome to June, loyal beer readers and drinkers! It's already been a busy week, with the announcement of the winners at the [Canadian Brewing Awards](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/05/29/2017cbas/), and the opening of Horton Ridge Malt & Grain Company's [taproom and pilot brewery](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/05/31/hortonridge/). We've got plenty more news to share with you today, so grab that coffee stout and take a few minutes to get up to speed. Look for our take on the ANBL domestic beer price reduction shortly.

• Kicking off the beer release news is [FirkinStein](https://www.facebook.com/FirkinStein-Brewing-754150891380564/), located just outside Bridgewater in Mount Pleasant, who have released a new beer this week, called _Tempus Fugit_ IPA. At 8.0% ABV, many would consider it a Double IPA (and it **is** packed to the gills with hops like one), including **Cascade**, **Citra**, **Perle**, **Saaz**, and **Mosaic**! It’s got a strong bitterness and prominent hop aroma, and is a touch drier and quite a bit lighter in colour than their flagship IPA, _Cut of Our Jib_. _Tempus Fugit_ will only be available at the brewery and their market stalls. Meanwhile, [Bishops Cellar](https://bishopscellar.com/) in Halifax has been carrying the first bottled offerings from FirkinStein and have sold out of the _Rock Your Boat_ Oatmeal Coffee Stout. But fear not, you should see their Amber, _Nor’Easter_ appear there sometime in the coming week. And watch this space in the coming weeks for news of a new retail space for the brewery.

• Over to New Brunswick, where Shediac’s [Flying Boats Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/Flying-Boats-Brewing-1580598582194710/) is releasing the first in a series of beers for the summer. _Galaxy Session IPA_ kicks off the lineup by featuring a very popular hop of late, the Australian variety **Galaxy**, which is known for a blast of tropical passion fruit and citrus characteristics. The beer comes in at a very sessionable 4.7% ABV, which should make for easy drinking in the summer sun. This one will appear on tap at the [James Joyce Pub](http://jamesjoycepub.com/) in Fredericton as well as at ANBL growler stations (probably Dieppe and/or Moncton). Keep an eye on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Flying-Boats-Brewing-1580598582194710/) for Growler Alerts to find out when it’s coming up in rotation! Brewer **Marc Melanson** will be introducing more beers in this series as the summer goes on featuring either single hop varietals or blends, and we’ll try to let you know about every one of them!

• And moving across the Northumberland Strait to the Island, we told you last week about the [North Brewing](http://northbrewing.ca/) [Taproom Takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/1909413729296436/) this afternoon at [Upstreet](http://www.upstreetcraftbrewing.com/). One of the beers you’ll find if you’re lucky enough to be at that event in Charlottetown is a beer co-brewed by Upstreet’s **Mike Hogan** when he was in Halifax a month or two back. _Holiday Island_ is an IPA in the session range, at 5.1% ABV, with pale, honey, and kiln amber malts making up the grain bill. It was hopped to 35 IBU with **Azacca**, **Belma**, and **Pekko**, three recently released American varietals that promise to provide a big hop character. And if you happen to see the gang from North at this event or back in the HRM, be sure to congratulate them on their twin gold medals at the [Canadian Brewing Awards](https://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/)!

• Saint John's [Loyalist City](https://loyalistcitybrewing.ca) released their latest single-hop IPA to the wild this week, _El Dorado_. Ther **El Dorado** hop varietal lends an intense tropical fruit aroma of mango and stone fruit, and a light tweak to the base recipe gives a lighter body and slight sweetness to match the hop character. The beer is available now at [Cask & Kettle](https://www.facebook.com/caskandkettle/), and a few other spots in the Uptown area.

• Dartmouth’s [Nine Locks](http://ninelocksbrewing.ca/) released a new one earlier this week, a red ale they’re calling _Brewer’s Choice Ginger Rye_. This is a dusky red ale that is full-bodied and features subtle caramel notes and hints of ginger on the palate. It’s got a long finish enabled by the astringency of the rye and wheat malts used and an assertive spiciness that we suspect comes from both the rye and the ginger. It’s not a big beer at 5.6% ABV and certainly not overly bitter at 15 IBU, so expect it to be on the malty side of the spectrum. This is a limited release, so you’ll only find it at the brewery for now and possibly appearing at licensed taps around the city over the coming weeks.

• Wolfville's [Annapolis Cider](http://drinkannapolis.ca/) has a special small-batch this week, made with oft-overlooked apple varietals. _Geneva Crab Rosé_ is an 8.6% ABV blend made with a blend of dry cider from 100% hand-picked local Golden Hyslop crabapples, with fresh-pressed juice from Geneva Red crabapples added post-ferment for a brilliant colour and tannic character. The resulting cider has a significant tart finish, and is only available at their cidery on Main Street for a limited time.

• In addition, Annapolis has released their latest **Something Different**, _Sangria Cider_. The 7.0% abv Sparkling Cider was created by blending cool-fermented dry cider with a dry red wine from locally sourced Frontenac Red grapes. This blend was then finished with fresh-pressed apple juice, as well as juice from oranges, lemons and limes. From Annapolis, "With aromatic notes of citrus and crisp apple and the characteristic hints of cherry, blackcurrant and plum from the wine, this lively and refreshing rosé-hued cider is the perfect patio sipper." As with all of their Something Different releases, $0.50 will be donated to a local charity. This releases beneficiary is [L'Arche Homefires](https://www.facebook.com/Applewicks-LArche-Homefires-165367393048/) in Wolfville, who provide meaningful work opportunities for adults with special needs.

• Fredericton’s [Red Rover Craft Cider](https://www.redroverbrew.com/) released a “very limited” batch of a special treat yesterday. _Wyld_ is a cider that will appeal to those who are drawn to farmhouse funk and sour styles. Fermented with wild yeast, this is a still cider, which should accentuate the yeast character, and also quite dry, weighing in at 7% ABV. This small batch is only available at their cider house for pints or flagon fills to go, so get it before it’s gone. Meanwhile, Red Rover has plans for some more special treats in the next month that we’ll be sure to tell you about as their respective releases approach.

• And in even more cider news, [Muwin Estate Wines](http://muwinestate.com/) in the Annapolis Valley, the folks who bring you [Bulwark Ciders](https://bulwarkcider.com/), are launching a new line of fruit-forward ciders under the label _7 Shores_ that will appeal to both regular cider drinkers and those who are new to cider. Like their Bulwark products, these are built on a base of freshly-pressed 100% Annapolis Valley apples, but one with slightly less tannins for a smoother palate. They also sport a significantly lower ABV, at a very quaffable 4.8%. Two flavours are available out of the gate, _Peach Vanilla Bean_ and _Strawberry Lime_; look for them to appear soon at NSLC stores around the province.

• It’s been almost six months since we’ve had a new SMaSH from Greg Nash at [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/), when the **Simcoe**-laden _Danko_ was released back in November; so today’s release of _Hops & Dreams_ is a special day. This one features **Amarillo**, one of the brewing industry darling hops of the 2010s and a varietal known for imparting a juicy orange, grapefruit, and stone-fruit character. In short, a perfect hop for another East Coast/West Coast DIPA marriage that no doubt features the magic of Mr. Nash’s proprietary SMaSH technique. It’s 8% ABV and 100+ IBU, but like its five brethren, it probably drinks a whole lot easier than the numbers would suggest. So as you wobble back to the fridge for glass number 4 from that growler, don’t say we didn’t warn you! It’ll be available for pints and fills from noon today on North Street at the brewery and _Charm School Pub_.

• Those who attended the Friday session of the CBANS Full House event earlier this month had a chance to try a brand new collaboration beer from [2 Crows](https://www.2crowsbrewing.com/) and 2/3 of the motley crew from [902 BrewCast](http://www.902brewcast.com/) (1/3 had his beard caught in a rocking chair). And those folks liked it so much that they drained the keg that night, leaving none for the Saturday attendees, who are clearly not bitter about it. In ACBB exclusive news, there’s good news afoot: 2 Crows is releasing a limited run of cans of that beer, _In Theory_, a **Galaxy** and **Azacca** dry-hopped sour fermented with wild yeast, this coming Tuesday! Bright, tart, tropical, juicy and eminently crushable at 5.1% ABV and 18 IBU, you’ll also find it on tap at the brewery the day cans are released. So plan to grab a pint and see what all the fuss was about before you grab some cans to go!

• And speaking of the 902 BrewDudes, they released the fifth of their May #902sday episodes earlier this week, featuring a sitdown with **Brian Titus**, **Daniel Girard**, and **Jeff Green** of [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/). At over 2 hours in length, there is plenty to digest about their 20 years in operation, including false starts, the lean years, and their expansion(s) to the Halifax Seaport. [Grab the podcast](https://902brewcast.simplecast.fm/24), and a can of the much-lauded _JUICY!_ Double IPA, which is now available at the brewery, and releasing shortly at the private stores (and NSLC in a couple of weeks). From the brewery, "Dank, hazy, and lushly tropical. This double IPA delivers waves of mango, tangerine and pineapple without the bitter hit."

• One of the Annapolis Valley’s small breweries is fixing to get bigger. After [opening in February](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/02/08/lunns-mill-beer-co-lawrencetown-ns/) of this year with a 1.5bbl system, Lawrencetown’s [Lunn’s Mill](http://lunnsmill.beer) is already planning an upgrade to 5bbl; their new equipment should be on the way from the West Coast by the time you read this. They’re not waiting on delivery to increase their presence, though, as starting today you’ll see them opening Fridays from 12-6pm in addition to their previously established Thursday hours of 3:30-6:30pm. They’ve got growler and grunter fills available, or feel free to try a flight of 5 beers for $10. And if that’s not enough to draw you in, they’ve also got a limited quantity of their Stillwell Open category-winning collaboration with Boxing Rock, _April May and Juniper_ pouring!

•  As first reported by local blog [Halifax Retales](http://halifax.retales.ca/), [Cristall Wine Merchants](http://www.cristallwinemerchants.com/store/) in Bedford has [confirmed](http://mailchi.mp/cristallwinemerchants/cristall-hot-buys-april-26-may-906641?e=%5BUNIQID%5D) that it will be closing, and re-opening under a new name, this summer. "WestSide Beer Wine Spirits" will be opening at 287 Lacewood Drive in Clayton Park, in the former Brewdabaker's location. The larger location will allow for bigger selection, expanded cold storage, 8 growlers taps, and the ability to control their opening hours. Stayed tuned for more details and dates.

**There's lots going on in our region this weekend and the next few weeks...**

• [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) is holding a pair of mini-tap takeovers this weekend at both their Beergarden and Mothership on Barrington. **Today** at **BGonSG**, there are three [West Avenue](http://westavenue.ca/) ciders pouring now, with a [Beausoleil Oyster](http://www.oysterguide.com/maps/new-brunswick/beausoleil/) pop-up starting this afternoon. **Tomorrow** from noon on Barrington, there will be 3 kegs and 5 different bottles from Toronto's [Bellwoods](http://www.bellwoodsbrewery.com/) available for enjoyment.

• [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) has been quietly releasing small pilot brews and special beers through casks and kegs at their brewery taproom and Halifax's [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) for a couple of years, but they are now naming, and officially launching, this line of beers as the **After Hours **series. According to PEIBC's Brewmaster **Chris Long**, "This series is a way for the brewers to scale up ideas that we've had for new beers without committing to 50 hectoliters of it. Some start on a pilot system, and we'll have a 20 litre keg to put out there. Others are lower risk and start out on the 5 or 7 bbl system at one of the Gahan locations. These beers will be available on tap at the PEI Brewing Company taproom, select bars and restaurants in the Maritimes and through the growler programs at your local liquor stores." In celebration of this, PEIBC is taking over the taps **today** at the new [bar.1911](http://bar1911.com/) at 113 Longworth in Charlottetown. From **4 PM**, there will be twenty different pilot- or small-batch beers, including favourites like _Impatience Sour Brown_ and _Milk Stout_, as well as brand new offerings, such as _Scimitar Black IPA_, _Strawberry Pale Ale_, and _Barrel-Aged Brett Pale Ale_. The brewers will be onsite to answer your questions (and hear your suggestions for the next brews!), and music will be provided by [Bridgette Blanchard](http://www.bridgetteblanchard.com/), [Nudie](https://nudiemusic.com/), and Alex Madsen of [The Divorcees](http://www.thedivorceesband.com/). Check out the details on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1531913063519894/).

• The [BrewHopper](http://www.mybrewhopper.com/) app has launched in Fredericton, and they are holding their first tours this weekend. Starting **today**, thirsty visitors can hop on and off the BrewHopper bus as it takes them to the busiest beer spots on both the North and Southside. The app allows all ticketing/tracking to be done electronically, akin to ride-sharing apps available in other areas. Using the BrewHopper App (for [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brewhopper/id1190893544?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.readypass.clientapp_bh&hl=en)), you can track the bus' route and exact location, use it to warn you when the bus is getting close, and take care of your payment, too. The **River Hop** will run every Friday through the summer (including today) **6:00 PM-12:15 AM**, and take folks to both North and Southside locations (DJ Purdy's, GrayStone, King Street Ale House, James Joyce, Picaroons Roadhouse, Mama's Brew Pub, and Trailway Brewing), while the **Hill Hop** runs Saturdays **4:00-11:30 PM**, and stays on the Southside (DJ Purdy's, GrayStone, Grimross Brewing, Maybee Brewing , James Joyce, and Red Rover Ciderhouse). There are more maps, and details on the [Fredericton page](http://www.mybrewhopper.com/fredericton). Even if you will not be going on the tour this weekend, grab the free app to learn more about the stops, and to watch the bus icon scoot around the city. And if all goes well, the BrewHopper will be expanding to other cities, including Halifax and Ottawa. You can learn some more on the [BrewHopper Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mybrewhopper/) page as well.

• A reminder that the launch of the [St. John's Beer Tours](http://www.stjohnsbeertours.com/) is this weekend as well, with their _Scuff & Scoff_ tour running **today**, the _Ultimate Townie Brew Tour_ **tomorrow**, and the _Hoppy Highlights Tour_ Sunday.

The flavour of the Chaga comes through as earthy and woody. Pouring from opening at 10AM, visitors can grab a pint in a special Moncton Beer League glass (to keep), do pay-as-you-drink, or grab a growler to go. Speaking of growlers, in addition to _Chaga Pale Ale_, their _Robot Food IPA_ and _Killington IPA_ will also be available for sale to take away.

**Plenty of parting shots this week before we let you get back to your beer:**

- In addition to the _In Theory_ release today, [2 Crows](http://2crowsbrewing.com/) tapped the last keg of their wine 'n wild yeast-fermented _Crosswired_ earlier this week. If you're lucky, there's still a few glasses left!
- Halifax's [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) is re-releasing some favorites this week. Their APA _Burban Legend_ will return to the taps in its v2 form (dry-hopped with **Cascade** and **Amarillo**) in the next few days and the _Goseface Killah_ will be back for early summer refreshment as well. We'll have more news from GR in coming weeks with the second in their **SMaSH(mouth?)** series and a serious step up in their BetaBrew releases.
- Quispamsis, NB's [Hammond River Brewing](http://hrbrewing.ca/) is hoping to be brewing in their new expanded brewhouse by the end of next week. Until then, look for the first batch of the season for their _Watermelon Wheat_ on tap at the [Barrels' Head Gastropub & Wine Bar](http://www.thebarrelshead.com/) in Rothesay.
- [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) is also back with watermelon action, as their _Melonhead_ has returned for another year, this time featuring a cat named Whiskey on the label. On tap and in bottles at the Picaroons Roundhouse and The Brewtique and on it's way to The General Store in Uptown Saint John, The 5 Kings Restaurant & Picaroons Brewhouse in St. Stephen, and to ANBL locations throughout New Brunswick.
- This past Wednesday marked a new era for [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) fans in Halifax, after 20 years, their Gottingen location is finally licensed for full pints! We're not totally sure about their serving hours, so you may wish to check ahead, but if you're in the area definitely stop in, say hello, and grab a pint!
- Down in Digby, NS, [Roof Hound](http://roofhound.ca/) is debuting a new menu today, promising to "step things up in every way." Don't forget, brewer/owner **Les Barr** was a finalist on Masterchef Canada, so don't take that statement lightly. Meanwhile, their non-alcoholic _Blueberry Lemonade Soda_ is once again available for the designated drivers and kids in your crew.
- Eastern Shore's [Sober Island Brewing](http://www.soberislandbrewing.ca/) has announced their next beer to be released in the coming weeks. _Kirby's Canoe_ is a 5.0% ABV Rye Pale Ale, a light-bodied and -coloured beer featuring floral and citrus aromatics, along with the representative spiciness found in beers featuring rye malt. Look for it to appear on tap at their current home at Henley House, and during the market runs before the end of the month.
- Fredericton hopheads can rejoice that [Trailway](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) has a small batch of _Green Island_ available in cans at the brewery, alongside some more of their hoppy wheat ale, _Patio_. And speaking of patios, they've got one at the brewery now and it's opening today! Drop by **Saturday** for some beer and wood-fired goodies from [Milda's Pizza](http://mildaspizzas.com/).
