The PEI Brewing Company sent me a press release earlier today announcing a new limited release product.

Gahan Sydney Street Stout will be available for sale in 500ml bottles in all PEI Liquor Commissions outlets and select ANBL locations starting next week.  This will be the 5th Gahan Ale released by the PEI Brewing Company.  The beer is described as "full-bodied ale with roasted barley overtones and a dark creamy head."

“This newest ale is beer our brewers are very proud of ” says PEI Brewing Company President Jeff Squires.  “We are offering Sydney Street Stout as a limited release bottle this fall in PEI and New Brunswick.  We have brewed only one special batch of this great stout – when it’s gone – it’s gone.”

The PEI Brewing Company won both Gold and Silver Medals at the 2012 Canadian Brewing Awards held in Montreal, Quebec.  Gahan Iron Horse Brown was the Gold Medal winner in the Brown Ale category, and Gahan Sir John A’s Honey Wheat was the winner of the Silver Medal in the Wheat Beer -­‐ North American Style category.
