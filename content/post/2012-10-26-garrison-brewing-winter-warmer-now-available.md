As a sure sign that the white stuff isn't all that far off, Garrison Brewing's Winter Warmer is now available.  The [tasting notes on the Garrison website](http://adminpanel.garrisonbrewing.com/accounts/garrison/websites/garrisonbrewing.com/module_files/brewery/beer_group/2/beer/101.pdf) describe the beer as:


<blockquote>Complex and inviting aromatics of strawberry jam, cinnamon, clove, brown sugar and molasses. Rich caramel flavors dominate and persist through a warming finish; starts sweet with a touch of dryness followed by a smooth aftertaste of caramel and clove.</blockquote>


The beer will be available at NSLC locations and select private stores.  As per [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/garrisonbrewing), the brew is also expected to be available in New Brunswick.
