Happy Friday, folks! Hopefully you are staying dry despite the poor weather, courtesy of [Gabrielle](http://weather.gc.ca/hurricane/track_e.html). Maybe a nice weekend to grab a growler of your favourite local beer and stay inside?



	
  * The Many Hands Imperial Pale Ale, brewed as a collaboration between [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) and [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) will be available Saturday. In Halifax, Bridge will have the beer available in growlers at the shop, as well as on tap at [The Brooklyn Warehouse](http://brooklynwarehouse.ca/). Boxing Rock will also be at the Halifax Seaport Market with their 1L growlers, and it will also be available at their retail store in Shelburne,  [Shelburne Farmer's Market](https://www.facebook.com/ShelburneFarmersMarket) and the [Yarmouth Farmer's Market](http://www.yarmouthfarmersmarket.com/). Here are some [pictures](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.529687477110860) and a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3XoIBGoRM4) from the brew day. They added 2/3 of the 110lb (!!) of wet hops in the last 15min to let the aroma shine through without creating an overly bitter beer. Looks like fun brew day, can't wait to taste it!



	
  * Another Harvest Beer, [Big Spruce's](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) Hoppily Married, is also available now. Pick up a growler at the brewery, or find it on tap at the [Antigonish Townhouse](https://www.facebook.com/AntigonishTownhouse). This beer features tons of their on-farm-grown hops at all points during the beer, for a full hop bitterness, flavour, and aroma profile. They will also be brewing up a new batch of Kitchen Party Pale Ale with Centennial and Cascade hops from this year's harvest at Southan Farm in NB. Keeping it nice and local!



	
  * Speaking of the Townhouse, they had their house-brewed beer, Terry's Bitter, on for the first time this week. They blew through 4 kegs in a short time, and are now busy brewing to get it back on. Check their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Townhouse_Pub) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AntigonishTownhouse) page for the announcement, as I'm sure it won't last long next time, either!



	
  * [Hell Bay Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/Hellbaybrewing) has released their Dark Cream Ale in bottles again. It is available at the brewery, and soon at [Premier Wines & Spirits](http://premierwines.ca/store/) and [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) in Halifax. Their India Brown Ale was a big seller, so they've brewed up a second batch of that beer, which will be available soon. They also have expanded their brite tank arsenal, which will further expand their production and beer line-up.



	
  * The [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) has announced their next event: in October, they will be featuring Spring Gardenâ€™s Brew Pubs - [Rockbottom](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) and [Rogues Roost](http://www.roguesroost.ca/). On October 10 from 7-10 pm, they are hitting up Rockbottom. There will be drink & food specials, and a guest appearance from brewmaster [Greg Nash](https://twitter.com/__NASH__). Then, one week later, they will be repeating the fun at Rogues Roost.  Both events will be pay-as-you-go, and can accommodate up to 40 attendees. Please RSVP to [LadiesBeerLeague@gmail.com](mailto:LadiesBeerLeague@gmail.com) to get your name on the list for either or both socials.



	
  * Next Thursday, Sept 19, the [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) will be holding a Brewmasters Dinner at the [Gahan House Pub](http://www.gahan.ca/), as part of the [Fall Flavours Festival](http://www.fallflavours.ca). Attendees will be able to enjoy a unique three course meal at the Gahan House Pub and Brewery and then be transported to the PEI Brewery for a tour. Your evening starts at the Gahan House Pub where chefs will incorporate their local fine handcrafted ales into three courses, giving you a culinary sampling of the "local" flavour of the Gahan beer. After your meal, you will be transported to the PEI Brewing Company where the beer is brewed and bottled, for a tour. The tour will include the story of the Gahan beers and the PEI Brewing Company, along with a chance to sample the beers firsthand. Transportation is provided. There are two sessions (5pm and 7:30pm), and tickets are available [here](https://boxofficepei.com/venue/pei-fall-flavours-festival/show/2013-brewmasters-dinner).
