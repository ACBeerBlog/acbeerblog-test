Good morning, and welcome to the first Friday of November! The weather is now colder, and winter is around the corner, but the local beer continues to flow...

• [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) recently released a new winter seasonal, _Coffee Porter_. True to its name, it was brewed with 20 lbs of whole beans and "dry-hopped" (dry-coffeed?) with coffee grounds, also 20 lbs worth. The coffee comes from local roasters [Java Blend](http://javablendcoffee.com/), and is their [Fog City](http://javablendcoffee.myshopify.com/products/fair-trade-organic-fog-city) blend - with two roast levels that give a "bold flavour, with sweet, rich tones", expect plenty of roasted, coffee goodness. At 5.9% and 35 IBUs, it's available now in growlers and 650 mL bottles. And grab their _Russian Imperial Stout_, back on tap and in bottles at both Windmill and Gottingen locations.

• Continuing on with coffee beers, [FirkinStein Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/FirkinStein-Brewing/754150891380564) has debuted _Rock Your Boat_, a Coffee Oatmeal Stout. A smooth beer thanks to the addition of oatmeal, the coffee was provided by Lunenburg's [Laughing Whale Coffee Roasters](http://www.laughingwhalecoffee.ca/); the Rock Your Boat coffee is one of their dark roasts, and is described as "a blend of dark, mi-noir, and medium roasted Mexican beans, bolstered by full bodied Sumatra". While the Hubbard's Farmers Market has shut down for the season, FirkinStein can be found at the [Lunenburg Farmers' Market](https://lunenburgfarmersmarket.ca/) every Thursday morning.

• [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co-301456876447/) has a brand new beer pouring at their brewpub in Saint John, _Barbarossa's Black IPA_. Brewed with Pale Ale, Munich, "dark" CaraMunich, Chocolate Wheat, and Black malts, it was heavily hopped with **Hallertau**, **Magnum**, and **Citra**, to 70 IBUs. A medium-bodied, dark brew exhibiting a "toasty, biscuity malt profile, balanced well with citrusy hop flavours", it weighs in at 6.8% ABV. Drop by for a pint and/or growler today! Their _Barrelled Life Barley Wine_ is also currently pouring.

• The [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/)/[Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/)/[North](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) collaboration, _Battery Rock_ India Brown Ale, was launched at the epic Tap Takeover at Battery Park last night. For those who missed out, it is available on tap around the HRM now, and in growlers and 650 mL bottles at both Boxing Rock and North, and their Farmers' Market stalls. With a "dark, complex, creamy malt base with notes of coffee, caramel and smoke", it brings in the IPA side with notes of tropical fruit and citrus in the aroma. Highly drinkable at 5.7% ABV, look for bottles to appear in the Halifax private liquor stores as well, likely by next week.

• The new beers from [Tide & Boar Brewing](http://www.tideandboar.com/) continue to flow at the brewpub in Moncton; this week has featured _Strawberry Ale Shake_, a style known simply as "Milkshake IPA" that has been quickly growing in popularity with North American breweries. Featuring the addition of lactose to increase the body and add a touch of lingering sweetness, real strawberries were also added, as well as heavy hop additions in the whirlpool, resulting in a fruity and murky brew. A true Double IPA at 8.1% ABV, only 3 kegs were brewed, so it likely won't last long... if it's even still on!

• Yesterday was [International Stout Day](http://stoutday.com/), and [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) released a new one-off at Saint John's General Store to celebrate. Brewed in conjunction with [Brú Brewery Meath](https://www.facebook.com/BruBreweryMeath/), out of County Meath, Ireland, _Irish Canadian Stout_ features the addition of Canadian maple syrup and Irish whiskey oak chips, to combine the best of both worlds. Still exhibiting plenty of roasted characteristics you expect to see in a stout, it comes in at 6.2% ABV and is available on tap at the General Store only.

• Digby's [Roof Hound Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/roofhound/) will be launching two new beers this Saturday, **November 5th**. _Roof Hound IPA_ is a 6.4% hop-bomb, brewed with guidance and assistance from [Bad Apple](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/)'s Jeff Saunders, featuring a boat-load of **Columbus** and **Mosaic** hops. _Big Brown Rum and Raisin Holiday Edition_ is a 7.5% Brown Ale with a holiday twist. Both beers will be flowing starting at 9pm, with live music from [Tide and Timbre](https://www.facebook.com/tideandtimbre/) and Hannah Morgan starting at 10:00 PM. And while the 7:30pm seating for their upcoming [Festive Supper Club](https://www.facebook.com/roofhound/posts/948300371980155) on **December 1st** is sold out, there are a few spots available for the 5:00 PM seating. [Email](mailto:roofhoundbrewing@gmail.com) for more details and to reserve your spot.

• This weekend [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com)** **continues their association with [Hal-Con](http://hal-con.com/), now in its 7th year as the premier sci-fi, fantasy and gaming convention in Atlantic Canada, with two adult and one all-ages formulations. First, for the grownups, the _Klingon Warnog_ Roggen Dunkel (Dark Rye) is available at the brewery once again. First brewed for Hal-Con 2014 under license from the [Federation of Beer](http://www.federationofbeer.com/), it is fundamentally in the Dunkelweizen style. On a firm base of Munich and Wheat malts a significant addition of Rye provides spiciness, while dark Crystal malt gives it the characteristic colour of the style. Lightly hopped with **Cascade** to 20 IBUs, this 5.5% ABV brew uses an authentic Weizen yeast to provide clove and banana esters to pair with caramel and chocolate notes from the malt. Also for those of legal age, and making a repeat appearance after being introduced in June of this year to mark the 50th anniversary of the original television series, _Star Trek Golden Anniversary Ale_ has been re-released  just in time for the convention. A light and refreshing, 5% ABV, slightly sweet beer featuring only pale and wheat malts along with 20 IBUs and a spiciness provided by the noble **Hallertauer** hop, it’s filtered sparkling clear and has a solid, long-lasting white head. It’s available in 650 mL bombers from the brewery and at private liquor stores around the HRM area. Lastly, appropriate for both kids and the kid in all of us, is _Sweet Nelson Power Soda_, a Raspberry Ginger Ale featuring a suitably fantastic lime-green colour. Brewed under the auspices of Garrison division Dockside Soda Co., it is returning to Hal-Con this year after a tremendously popular introduction at last year’s event.

• If your appetite for pumpkin beers doesn’t quite justify a growler fill, or you’re just curious about how the other half lives, the [Nine Locks Brewing](http://ninelocksbrewing.ca/) fall seasonal _Pumpkin Ale_ is now available in cans at the brewery. Still 5.2% and 12 IBUs and still featuring a malty backbone and full mouthfeel balancing the crisp spicing, this amber ale will surely give way soon to a winter offering, so get it while it lasts. Meanwhile, not resting on their gourds, Nine Locks is also releasing another beer this week, _Scotch Ale_. Inspired by the Scottish ales of the 18th and 19th centuries, it’s a strong beer at 7.5%, and is dark with ruby highlights, and deeply malty. Typical of the style, it comes in at a fairly low 22 IBUs while dark grains and a crisp finish complete the picture. This one will be available in the next couple of weeks for growler fills and in cans, both at the brewery.

• [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) has teamed up with Ontario's [Beau's All Natural Brewing Co.](https://www.facebook.com/BeausBrewery/) for a very worthy cause - to help build the first women-owned and operated brewery in Rwanda. Until November 17th, $2 for every pint and growler sold in the Upstreet taproom will go to help this project. For more information on the Rwanda brewery, and to donate yourself directly, check out their [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beaus/the-rwanda-craft-brewery-project).

• There's a couple of new beers from [Graystone](http://graystonebrewing.com/) on tap for growler fills and pints: _Into the Woods Brown Ale_, a 5% ABV, 26 IBUs "medium-bodied ale with caramel and chocolate flavours", and _Pitch Stout_, a 4.5% ABV American Oatmeal Stout that is full-bodied, "with notes of chocolate and a moderate roast character".

• Beer lovers in Sackville, NB (aka Bagtown), will be able to enjoy beer brewed in their town in the new year. The just-announced [Bagtown Brewing Company](https://www.facebook.com/bagtownbrewing/) is a student project at [Mount Allison University](https://www.mta.ca), which sees students go through the steps of investing and opening their own business. While still in the licensing phase, they do have a location for their nano-sized brewery, which will set up in the newly-opened [Sackville Commons](https://www.facebook.com/CoworkSackville/). Follow along on their progress on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/bagtownbrewing) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bagtownbrewing/), and we'll be sharing more details shortly.

**November is a busy month, with loads of newly-announced events in the next few weeks:**

• [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) was recently voted Best Brewery and Best Brewpub by readers of [The Coast](https://www.facebook.com/TheCoastHalifax/), and they're celebrating with a crazy event - [a tap takeover at their own taproom](https://www.facebook.com/events/185432905246510/),** today**. A total of 11 different GR beers will be available, the most they've ever had on at one time. Check out the event link for full beer details! This self-serving event - ;) - will continue all weekend.

• [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) is holding a special all-cider event tomorrow on **Saturday, November 5th**, featuring Ontario's [West Avenue Cider Company](http://westavenue.ca/). A bevy of special ciders will be pouring all day (check out the full list [here](https://www.facebook.com/barstillwell/photos/pcb.1263094443763913/1263093803763977/?type=3&theater)) starting at noon, with no tickets required to attend. In addition, a special food menu has been put together that will optimally pair with all these tasty beverages; be sure to drop by for an epic sampling!

• [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) is once again teaming up with the [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/The-James-Joyce-Pub-187205728006725/?fref=ts) for another [Guy Fawkes-themed event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1739945192937469/), **Saturday, November 5th**. Plenty of Red Rover cider will be pouring, including three special releases, two of which are "James Joyce specialties", and a mystery cask. It all starts at 8:30 pm; as usual, there is no cover charge.

• There are a plethora of events at various bars, restaurants, and breweries on **Tuesday, November 8th**, to "celebrate" Election Day in the U.S., when we can finally say, for better, worse, or worser, that this election has finally (hopefully) come to an end. There's too many to list, but check out Facebook and you won't have a problem finding one near you. Beer makes bad things better!

• [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) is holding a tap takeover next **Thursday, November 10th**, at Halifax's [Lion & Bright](https://www.facebook.com/lionandbright/). There will also be live music from [Dave Sampson](https://www.facebook.com/dsampsonmusic/) and [Colin Grant](https://www.facebook.com/colingrantfiddle/). The boys from Breton will be bringing in a full complement of eight beers to pour for you, and the kitchen at L&B will be whipping up Cape Breton-inspired snacks. Look for their core lineup, as well as seasonals _Jack'd Up_ Pumpkin Ale, _Celtic Colours_ Maple Lager, and _Tart'an Juicy Grapefruit_ Pale Ale. Plus, a brand new beer, _MacAskill's Revenge _Black IPA, which launched last evening. At 7.0% ABV and 80 IBUs, you best stay on MacAskill's good side!

• Local homebrewer Keith Forbes has been busy brewing up a storm at Good Robot over the past 6 weeks, and will be holding one heck of a party at the GR Tap Room **November 15th**. The first of their [BrewBot - Homebrew Tap Takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/1208102622546156/) series will feature five beers brewed on GR's[ Sabco Brew-Magic](https://www.brewmagic.com/) system. A very active member of the [Brewnosers](http://www.brewnosers.org/forums/) Homebrew Club, Forbes will be showcasing some award-winning beers, including his Gold Medal-winning _Funktown American Pale Ale_, and _Muddy River Brown_, a favourite with family and friends. The party kicks off at 5:00 pm.

• While their beer has been available in Moncton for over a month, [Beckwith Road Brewing](http://beckwithroad.com/) is taking a breath, and finally holding their Launch Party later this month. Being held at 400 St George St, 7:00 - 11:00 pm, **November 26th**.

Before we sign off for the day...

- As we mentioned last week, the ANBL new growler station at [Moncton North](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=Moncton+North+%2F+Nord) is launching this weekend; be sure to drop by for growler fills of local beers that include [Bore City](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/) _Mondo IPA_, [Flying Boats](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710) _Dixie Clipper IPA_, and [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) _Scotch Ale_, while supplies last.
- Rothesay, New Brunswick's [Foghorn Brewing](http://www.drinkfoghorn.ca/) looks to be launching soon, as they've been teasing pictures of filled kegs (we assume!) on social media... if you're in the area, your wait is almost over!
- [Hammond River](http://hrbrewing.ca/) has released the latest iteration of their single-malt-and-single-hop beer, _The Vegas SMaSH_; this ones features the always-wonderful **Citra** hop, so be sure to ask your local watering hole if they carry it!
- [Hell Bay](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/)'s Black IPA, _Black Flag IPA_ (6.1% ABV, 55 IBUs), is now available in 12 oz bottles at the brewery; look for it to pop up at liquor stores in NS in the near future as well.

Look out for _Homegrown Wet Hop_, _Shack Wacky _Cider, _Cold Porridge _Oatmeal Stout, _Smokey Chipotle _Porter, _Ashdale_ Honey Brown, and_ Surf & Turf _Scotch Ale in 500 ml bottles. Meander River will be at the [Christmas at the Forum](https://www.christmasattheforum.com/) this weekend, and [The Guy Show](http://guyshowhalifax.com/) and [Saltscapes](http://www.saltscapes.com/SSHH/) shows next weekend.
- Winter Warmer season is upon us, which is a bittersweet thing. This means, of course, that [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/)'s Winter Warmer, _Buckdjeuve_ (7.3% ABV, 29 IBUs), is back for the season. You can find it in growlers and six-packs at the brewery now, and in sixers at select ANBL locations.
- Picaroons _Winter Warmer_ (7.3% ABV, 35 IBUs) is back as well, on tap at both the Brewtique and General Store, select bars/restaurants, and in bottles.
- This year's edition of the Pump House _Stonefire Ale_ is now available, in a limited number of four thousand 750 mL bottles, at the brewery and soon in ANBL stores. This marks the third year for this 6.5% ABV beer, which was brewed by heating the wort through the addition of extremely hot rocks, as per an ancient German method.
- [Saltbox](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) _Scottish Ale_ (5.5% ABV, 15 IBUs) is back on tap this week, but in a very limited quantity, so be sure to drop by and pick some up!
