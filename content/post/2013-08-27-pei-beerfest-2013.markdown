The [Prince Edward Island Beer Festival](http://beerfestpei.ca/), produced by the [Prince Edward Island Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/), will take place Sept 6-7, 2013 at the [New Charlottetown Event Grounds](http://www.peibeerfest2013.com/contact/) at 360 Grafton St.  This revamped event, kicking off the [Fall Flavours Festival](http://www.fallflavours.ca/index.php), will be focused on educating visitors and Islanders alike on the art and craft of brewing and tasting beer. The festival will feature over 75 beers, VIP packages, food pairings and late night entertainment on the beautiful Charlottetown waterfront.

There are three tasting sessions planned for the festival. The first will be on Friday from 6-9 pm, then two on Saturday: 2-5 pm, and another later session from 6-9 pm. Tickets for the Saturday afternoon session are $30 each, while both of the evening sessions are $40. Keep in mind that tickets for the evening sessions also include admission into the apres-Fest entertainment, also taking place at the Charlottetown Event Grounds.

There are also VIP tickets available for those looking to experience even more at the festival. For $99, ticket-holders will have access to a behind-the-scenes tour at the PEI Brewing Company from 4-6 pm before each evening tasting session, guided by the brewers themselves. Got questions about some of your favorite PEI Brewing Co/Gahan beers, such as recipe and/or brewing technique secrets? The brewers will be there to answer everything you're anxious to know! There will also be complimentary food and beer-pairing treats, and a merchandise gift pack to take home. A shuttle will take you to the Event Grounds, so you will not miss a minute of the Fest.

Each of the three tasting sessions will feature live acoustic entertainment from local artists, including Ryan Merry, Chris Field, Andrew Waite and Ashley Gorman. As for the late night entertainment, Friday's session will feature [Ten Strings And A Goat Skin](http://www.tenstringsandagoatskin.com/) and [The Chris Dalziel Band](http://www.chrisdalziel.com/), and Saturday's will showcase [More Soul](https://www.facebook.com/MoreSoulBand) and Some Guys (a Rolling Stones tribute band). The late night shows will run from 9 pm - 1 am; if you're not attending one of the evening tasting sessions, entertainment tickets can be purchased separately for $20. Even though the Fest will be closed after 9pm each night, there will be a pub set up, serving local and select beer from the Fest to music-lovers.

So, what about the beer? As mentioned above, there will be more than 75 different beers available, from sponsor [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) (including a special Spanish Cedar-aged IPA), Fredericton's [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons), Moncton's [Pumphouse](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/), Halifax's [Garrison Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/garrisonbrewing), Toronto's [Mill Street](https://www.facebook.com/MillStreetBrewery) and [Amsterdam](http://amsterdambeer.com/) breweries (both with several beers not available at the PEILC), and Saint John's [Moosehead](https://www.facebook.com/moosehead) (including their Cask Ale, usually only available at the [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/), and the new Boundary Ale). Other new/interesting/standout beers include Erdinger Weiss and Dunkel Weissbier,  Mort Subite Kriek, St. Ambroise Oatmeal Oatmeal Stout and Pumpkin, and Coors Banquet.

Food will be served by a handful of local restaurants, free tasting bites to Festival goers. There will also be a Designated Drivers area for non-drinkers to still enjoy the music and great ambiance, and will include some comfy chairs and soda pop to keep hydrated while hanging with imbibing friends.
