Good morning! As August comes to an end and the long weekend begins, beer news in our region has slowed down... but only slightly. Let's get right into what's going on in our region!

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) is releasing a new beer next week, their first Double IPA! _Selection Double IPA_ is brewed with no less than seven hop varieties: **Pride of Ringwood**, **Bramling Cross**, **Cascade**, **Orbit**, **Galaxy**, **Sorachi Ace**, and **Slovenian**. Coming in at around 80 IBUs and 7.9% ABV, this new beer will be released next Thursday, Sept. 4th for growler fills only, at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133) when it opens. It will also be a part of the ANBL pilot program for growler fills; no word yet if this will be at all three ANBL stores participating in the program, or just the [Prospect Street](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=Prospect) location.

• Distribution for [Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) is expanding, as one of their two inaugural beers, _Tante Blanche_ (a Witbier) is now available at ANBL stores in Fredericton (York St. location), Dieppe (Régis St.), and Moncton (Vaughn Harvey Blvd.). Also, their Belgian Blonde, _Bob LeBoeuf_, should be following at the same locations sometime next week. Look for both beers to continue to make their way across the province; we'll be sure to keep you updated as to their availability.

• Speaking of Petit-Sault, they're currently hiring for the position of Sales and Marketing Rep. Are you in good physical shape, bilingual (a must for the position), and want to hang out with a very friendly staff (we can attest to this)? Well, now's your chance! The position includes ordering, promotional events, ongoing relationships with bars/restaurants and ANBL stores, making deliveries, rotating inventory, etc. If you're interested, send your resume to them via [email](mailto:info<at>petitsault.com), no later than September 5th. More info on the position is available [here](http://petitsault.com/en/blog/31-offre-d-emploi-coordonnateur-trice-developpement-de-marches).

• And while on the topic of job-hunting, [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is also looking to fill some part-time positions at their retail store and promotional events in Halifax. If you're hard-working and enthusiastic (read: love craft beer), send a resume via [email](mailto:jgreen<at>garrisonbrewing.com) to Jeff Green ASAP.

• With the grand opening of the new [Gahan House](http://halifax.gahan.ca/) location on the Halifax waterfront approaching, the [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague) is holding a special sneak peek on Monday, Sept. 8th from 7:00 - 9:00 pm. During this time, ticket-holders will be given a "Beer 101" and introduction to Gahan's expansion to Halifax. They will then be led through a guided tasting of 10 different Gahan/PEI Brewing Co. beers by brewmaster Karen Allen. Tours of the new brewery will also be offered, and attendees are encouraged to stick around after to order food and more beer. The beer will be a combination of unique offerings brewed onsite by Allen, as well as those in the PEI Brewing lineup. Only [30 spots](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ladies-beer-league-sneak-peak-at-gahan-house-tickets-12845093019) were available, and they sold out within 24 hours (sorry)! We understand this is just the beginning of an enduring relationship between the Ladies Beer League and Gahan, and we can look forward to a beer dinner this winter, as well as other exciting events from the LBL this fall. Keep an eye on their [Events page](http://ladiesbeerleague.ca/?post_type=tribe_events) for more details.

• [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/) has another beer hitting shelves at the ANBL this week. _Big Brown Ale_ has been available on tap at certain bars/restaurants across the province, and on tap for growler fills at the brewery, and is now joining _Blonde du Quai_ and _Siren's T'Ale_ in 500 ml bottles. As usual, it should be hitting stores in the Charlo area first, but will spread to other outlets in the very near future.

• [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) in Halifax is releasing their latest new beer today, _Rhubarb π_. This beer weighs in at 4.6% and very low IBUs (from **East Kent Golding**), but the highlight here is the sour character imparted by the choice of Lactobacillus bacteria as the fermenting workhorse, which produces lactic acid for an acidic and tart flavour, hence the rhubarb name. Grab a pint of it at the 'bottom today! This is the second lacto sour done by brewer Greg Nash, the first being last year's [Synaptic Illusion](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2013/10/synaptic-illusion.html).

• [Hell Bay Brewing](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) has sent the final few kegs of their new _India Brown Ale_ to [Bar Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) for the city folks to enjoy (the rest was sold to thirsty locals in the Liverpool region). The beer is sweet and malty upfront, and leads to hints of rum and molasses with a dry finish, and weighs in at 6.5% and 45 IBUs.  Brewer Mark Baillie tells us that the next version of the _R.I.P.(A.)_ will be out soon, and will make its debut in bottles for the first time (will also be available in kegs and growlers, as were previous versions). We'll have more recipe details closer to the release.

• It's Hop Harvest Time in our region! While several breweries in the Atlantic Provinces will be brewing up Wet Hop beers in the next couple of weeks, we believe the first to do so was [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) in Nyanza. With help from some volunteers, they picked their own farm-grown **Magnum**, **Cascade** and **Mt Hood** hops, and brewed up _Hoppily Remarried_ earlier this week. While the IBUs are not available, they used enough hops to get them into Imperial IPA range, with an expected ABV of 8.4%. Look for this beer at the brewery and select tap accounts in September.

• [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released another One-Hit Wonder, the _Cluster Bomb IPA_. It weighs in at 7.1% ABV and 64 IBUs, thanks to a ton of **Cluster** hop in the brew. And what a great Lambic launch event at Stillwell last week! The Framboise Lambic was a big hit, and after selling out at Stillwell, the beer sold like hotcakes on Monday at both the Halifax and Dartmouth locations. Look for the other beer in the Lambic series in the coming months, including a blackberry, cherry, and non-fruited version.

• This weekend, the fifth annual [Oktoberfest des Acadiens](http://www.oktoberfestdesacadiens.com/) is being held in the village of Bertrand, NB. Starting yesterday and continuing through to Sunday, activities include Bavarian music and dancing, live entertainment, games, and of course, beer! There will be several beer tastings throughout the weekend, including two by [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301) owner/brewer Patrice Godin (these were by reservation only). Tickets and passes are still available online through their website.

• Our contest to win two tickets to the PEI Beer Festival next weekend has come to an end, and the winner is... Derek Stapleton! Congratulations, Derek! Contact us as soon as possible and let us know which of the three sessions you'd prefer to attend, and we'll hook you up with the tickets. Since our post last week, they have announced After-Parties for both Friday and Saturday nights. Drop by [Fishbones Oyster Bar](http://fishbones.ca/) for more food, drink, and music (Friday: [In-Flight Safety](https://www.facebook.com/inflightsafety) + [Coyote](https://www.facebook.com/wearecoyote), Saturday: [The North Lakes](https://www.facebook.com/thenorthlakes) + [Wildcat](https://www.facebook.com/wildcatpei)).
