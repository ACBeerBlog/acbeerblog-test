Happy Friday everyone! Now that spring is in full swing, be sure to grab a local beer, and enjoy it outside! Here are some new beers, new events, new jobs, and more!

• [Hell Bay](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) has released their _R.I.P.(A.)_ version 3.0. Brewed with a different malt and hops recipe than the two [previous](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/friday-wrap-up-20140117/) [versions](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/friday-wrap-up-20140307/), this beer has a maltier body, and a citrus hop presence. Despite these changes, the beer once again weighs in at 7.2%ABV and 70IBUs. Drop by the brewery in [Liverpool](http://goo.gl/maps/OPq1P) for a growler, and look for it on tap around the province shortly.

• [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) has announced that they're currently brewing up two new summer seasonals, and we have some info on both of them. The first beer is described as a Hawaiian-style Pale Ale; it's brewed with fresh pineapples, along with Chinook and Cascade hops, and then dry-hopped with more Cascade. It clocks in at 5.8% ABV and 55 IBUs. The other seasonal is a Fruit Beer... more specifically, a Blueberry Ale that is brewed with real blueberries, not extract, which will give the beer a purplish color. This one will come in at 5.4% ABV and 38 IBUs. Both seasonals will rotate in production with one another, so look for them both to be making appearances over the next few months in the Saint John area, starting with the Hawaiian APA in the next couple of weeks.

• To coincide with the [Atlantic Beer Festival](http://atlanticbeerfestival.ca/) on May 31st in Moncton, the [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) is releasing two beers for sale in six-packs for the first time. First, the _Premium Pilsner_ that had a limited release around last Christmas (in 750 mL swing top bottles) will now be available as the newest seasonal beer. A [German-style Pilsner](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style02.php#1a) weighing in at about 5.7% ABV and 30 IBUs, it arrives just in time for the warmer weather (more info on the beer [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/22/friday-wrap-up-20131122/)). Second, they'll be releasing a brand new IPA! No, not their regular IPA (that has always been popular with hop lovers, and only available on tap at select locations)... a new beer entirely, also in the American IPA style. No specifics on this one yet, but we'll let you know as soon as we can! Both six-packs will be available at the brewery and [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) locations at the end of the month/first of June, after an original launch at the Atlantic Beer Festival.

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) has announced the date of sale for tickets to their Brewer's Bash this summer, July 12th - they go on sale next Tuesday, May 20th. Starting at 10:00 am, you can pick them up at the [Cedar Tree Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/cedartreecafe) in downtown Fredericton, or find them online [here](https://etixnow.com/events/brewers-bash-jul-12); the price is $25. Tickets sold out fairly quickly last year; even with 500 more tickets available for this year's festival, expect it to sell out at least as fast as last year. Check out [last week's post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/05/09/friday-wrap-up-20140509/) for a bit more info on the Bash.

• Looking to work in the brewery business, but not necessarily as a brewer? Well, the [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) is looking to fill a position for **Retail and Sales Manager** at their retail store in the brewery. You'll need a university degree or diploma in Business, Marketing, or a related field, with a minimum of 2 years sales and marketing experience in a retail environment. Contact Cara Squires by [email](mailto:csquires<at>peibrewingcompany.com) for more information, and/or to submit a resume. More details [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BnnAB59IAAMJ0_5.jpg:large).

• A reminder that the [2014 Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) are being held in Fredericton at the end of the month, May 29-31. The three day event is being held at the [Fredericton Conference Centre](http://www.frederictonconventions.ca/) in the city's downtown, with satellite events across the city. Featuring some excellent panels, talks and presentations from brewers, distributors and ingredient and equipment manufacturers, this is a must-visit for anyone involved in the beer industry. The Awards Gala, being held Saturday night, and live-broadcast from the CBA website, will be the highlight of the weekend. This is when the winning beers and breweries will be announced, after the impressive job Tracy Phillippi and the panel of judges did, making their way through more than 900 submissions in Toronto last month. For those brewers who have not yet signed up, it's not too late! Visit the CBA website for further information on the [schedule](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/schedule/) and email [Katrina](mailto:kristina<at>tapsmedia.ca) to sign up.

• [Propeller Brewing's](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) new [Windmill Rd](http://goo.gl/maps/R4UcZ) location is celebrating its first "Food Truck Friday" today. [Cheese Gypsy Mobile Cuisine](http://www.cheesegypsy.ca/) will be  set up 11:30-4 today, and every Friday this spring and summer, for folks to have some food to wash down their beer. From Andrew Cooper, "We're quite excited about the local food truck scene and really want to be involved with it." They join [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) on [Agricola St](http://goo.gl/maps/ep9HX), who host [The Food Wolf](http://www.thefoodwolf.com/) every Sunday 12-4 and [Seaport Farmers' Market](http://www.halifaxfarmersmarket.com/) / [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/), where [Nomad Gourmet](http://www.nomadgourmet.ca/) hangs out Saturday 7-3 and Sunday 9-3. To keep an eye on where these and the other food trucks are in the HRM, be sure to check out the [Street Food App](http://streetfoodapp.com/halifax) website.

• Speaking of Propeller, hot on the heels of their very popular _Black IPA_, they've brewed up two more _One Hit Wonders_ at the Gottingen St brewery. While too early to release the details, Andrew Cooper assure us that they will be available soon, and released back to back, to reduce lag time between them. In previous years, these one-offs have included _Zwickelbier,_ _Imperial Red_, _SPA_ (Special Pale Ale), so we're sure these upcoming ones will be just as special!

• Today's Cask at the [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/) is a _Double Dry-Hopped Kitchen Party Pale Ale_ from [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/). Brewmaster Jeremy White let us know that the _KP_ was dry hopped with Centennial in the conditioning tank, then blasted with a dose of Amarillo in the cask. After grabbing a grilled cheese sandwich and growler in Dartmouth, this sounds like a great start to the long weekend!

• Tickets for the [2014 NLC Beer Expo](http://www.nlliquor.com/events/special-events/beer-expo-2014) are now on sale. Being held June 6th and 7th, the Expo will showcase beer from across the country, and around the world. The list of beers is [available here](http://www.nlliquor.com/events/special-events/~/media/Images/BeerExpo%202014/BE14%20Beer%20Expo%20Booklet%20web.ashx), and features over 100 different products, about 20% of which are not normally available in the province. Tickets are still available for the Friday night session, which can also include an exclusive [Tasting Panel](http://www.nlliquor.com/events/special-events/beer-expo-2014#Tasting%20Panel) before the Fest, lead by folks from the Mill Street, Muskoka, and Unibroue.

• A quick reminder that Meander River Farm and Brewery is opening tomorrow! From 10-5, drop by their [Ashdale, NS](https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=Meander+River+Farm+%26+Brewery,+Woodville+Road,+Mount+Uniacke,+NS&hl=en&sll=45.011419,-63.816833&sspn=0.321842,0.837021&oq=meander+&hq=Meander+River+Farm+%26+Brewery,&hnear=Woodville+Rd,+Mt+Uniacke,+Nova+Scotia+B0N+1Z0&t=m&z=14) location to tour the brewery and grounds, check out some of the [lavender and hops products](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.450059421706705.101900.166978860014764&type=1), and other merchandise, and of course, grab some beer! We'll see you there!

In closing, we mentioned in our post on the upcoming Atlantic Beer Festival [yesterday](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/details-on-the-2014-atlantic-beer-festival/) that we'd be holding a contest for a giveaway of two tickets for the afternoon session (2:30 - 5:00 pm). Starting now, hop on Twitter and send us a note like: [Hey @ACBeerBlogger! I want to win tickets to #ABF2014! http://wp.me/p23UN6-1gZ](http://www.twitter.com/home?status=Hey+@ACBeerBlogger%21+I+want+to+win+tickets+to+%23ABF2014%21+http://wp.me/p23UN6-1gZ). One entry per person; we'll randomly pick the winner and announce their name in next Friday's post. The contest will run from now until next Thursday at 11:59 pm. Good luck!
