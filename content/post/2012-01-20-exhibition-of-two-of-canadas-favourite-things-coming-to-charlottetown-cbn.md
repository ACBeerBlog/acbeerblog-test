Thanks to @BrewersofCanada for tweeting to me (is that proper social media-ese?) about [this post on Canadian Beer News](http://www.canadianbeernews.com/2012/01/19/new-confederation-centre-exhibition-to-feature-hockey-beer/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CanadianBeerNews+%28Canadian+Beer+News%29).Â  Canada's two greatest passions (beer and hockey) will be combined in a new exhibit called _Hockey Bar _at the Confederation Centre of Arts in Charlottetown, PEI from February 4th to April 15th.
