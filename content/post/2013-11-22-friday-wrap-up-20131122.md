Happy Friday! What better way to warm up the end of your week (after all this cool weather) than with some beer news?

• As we mentioned in [our post on Wednesday](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/brasseurs-du-petit-sault-a-new-belgian-style-brewery-opening-next-year-in-new-brunswick/), the members of the Board of Directors at [Les Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) (the new Belgian-style brewery opening in Edmundston, NB next year) are looking to hire two brewers. They just posted the official job listing [here](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/actualites/20-offre-d-emploi-brasseur); looks like it is for a start date of around March 1st, 2014. Check it out/pass it along if you're interested; the deadline for résumés is December 22nd.

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) is introducing a new type of growler for fills of their on-tap beers at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133) in downtown Fredericton. An unbreakable, food-grade stainless steel [Hydroflask](http://www.hydroflask.com/), it keeps beer cold for many hours! It still holds the same amount of beer (1.89 L) as the old growlers, and can be brought back to the Brewtique for refills, of course. Each growler costs $50 to purchase; they're available now at the Brewtique.

• Next Friday, November 29th, tickets for the [2014 Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) will go on sale. With already more breweries and beers (with heavy emphasis on New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) than last year's festival, it's sure to be a great event! Like last year, tickets are $50 for regular admission, and $60 for VIP (which gets you entry into the festival an hour earlier). The festival will be held at the [Fredericton Convention Centre](http://www.frederictonconventions.ca/) on Saturday, March 8th. We'll be posting more details on the breweries/beers offered in the future!

• The [Beerthief](http://www.beerthief.ca/) Newfoundland and Labrador's Artisanal and Craft Beer Club has partnered with a local manufacturer to offer[ etched glassware](http://www.beerthief.ca/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=369&sid=9d67df084ab5f4d4ed1dd7bd0883ae3f) with their logo. At $8.50, one can choose a mug, pilsner, stemmed or tall "bar" glass. Contact [Mike Buhler](https://twitter.com/Beerthiefca) to order these.

• [Hell Bay Brewing](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) has released a special one-off beer, "Latzenbier". This [German Altbier](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style07.php#1c) is full-bodied with slight toffee/malt sweetness, and roasted aromas, and bittered with German hops. It weighs in a 5.5% ABV and 45 IBUs, and is only available in growlers at the [brewery in Liverpool](http://goo.gl/maps/nrRyr). Hell Bay has been sending more of their beer to bars and restaurants in the HRM, so if you don't see it on tap at your favourite watering hole, be sure to request it!

• The [Pump House Brewery](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) is releasing a new lager - Premium Pilsner is listed as a [German-style Pilsner](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style02.php#1a) brewed with Saaz hops. Clocking in at 5.7% ABV with 30 IBUs, Pump House describes the beer as very pale straw-colored; the beer is unfiltered, so some haziness will be present. With a flowery, slightly spicy and grassy aroma from the Saaz hops, the beer finishes very dry with a moderate bitterness. It will first be available in gift-box form, in 750 mL swing-top bottles. We haven't received confirmation as to when the beer will be available, but it should be very soon.

• [Quidi Vidi Brewing](http://www.quidividibrewery.ca/) has re-released their Mummer's Brew, just in time for the holiday season. An "Amber Ale" with an ABV of 6%, it's described as being "full of caramel malt flavors and aromas". Only a small amount has been brewed, and it's only available at the brewery and [NLC](http://www.nfliquor.com/) stores. Once it's gone, it won't be back until next year, so don't wait to pick some up!

• [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) now has their Left Breton Organic Conspiracy Imperial IPA available at the brewery. This is the beer that saw BC's [Crannóg Ale](http://www.crannogales.com/) brewers visit the brewery, bringing with them hops from [Left Fields](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Left-Fields/188041097885564) farm in Sorrento, BC (to complement the hops grown at Big Spruce's Breton Fields hop farm). All of the hops used in the beer were grown organically on these two fields: Galena for bittering, along with tons of Centennial and Cascade at the end of the boil, and dry-hopped with Cascade and Willamette. The final stats on this beer are 7.4%ABV and 81 IBUs. Pick some up now [at the brewery](http://goo.gl/maps/t8qNc) (it won't last long); it should also be available at the [Cape Breton Farmers' Market](https://www.facebook.com/CBFarmersMarket) in Sydney this weekend (along with some spent-grain granola). It may also be available at one exclusive tap in the province soon, keep your eyes open on their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BigSpruceBrew) feeds for that launch information. In addition to the Glenora-infused cask that Big Spruce had at the LBL Cask Fest, we were lucky enough to try the Bowmore 12-year-infused cask at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) in Halifax. It's gone now, but is another great indication of things brewing on Cape Breton.

• [Paddys Irish Brewpub](http://paddyspub.ca) has brewed up their newest eagerly-anticipated seasonal beer,  "Frost Biter" Winter Warmer. It has a chestnut colour, bolder body with notes of holiday chocolate, subdued bitterness at 10 IBUs, and a pleasant warming due to the slightly higher 6% Abv. Available at either their [Kentville](http://paddyspub.ca/locations/kentville/) or [Wolfville](http://paddyspub.ca/locations/wolfville/) location on tap and in 2 liter Growlers in early December.

• Fans of [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/)'s Spruce Beer, rejoice! The gang is at [Meander River Farms](https://www.facebook.com/MeanderRiverFarm) today, collecting spruce tips and branches for their popular seasonal. This means the beer will be hitting shelves within a few weeks. Check back here for details, and their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/garrisonbrewing) page for pictures of today's hunt.

• [Field Guide](http://fieldguidehfx.com/), a great new restaurant on Halifax's Gottingen Street has opened this past week. We went by for a great visit Wednesday, and will have a profile on them next week. They want to highlight the importance of the kitchen to the dining experience (you can watch the entire process of food preparation, from stove to plate and even the dish pit where the plate is cleaned after), and are passionate about local and seasonal food. Needless to say, they are big fans of local craft beer, and will be carrying NS beer exclusively.

That's it for this week... enjoy your weekend!
