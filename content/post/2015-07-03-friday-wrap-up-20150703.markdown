Welcome to the first Friday in July! We hope your Canada Day was a festive one, and you were able to celebrate with a local pint. Let's see what other new beers you'll soon be able to taste around our region!

• New Brunswick's newest brewery, [Flying Boats Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710) in Shediac, has released their first beer, _Picnic Train Witbier_. A refreshing, easy-drinking seasonal release named after a "popular summertime train service between Moncton and Pointe-du-Chene wharf to bring passengers to Parlee Beach in the early part of 1900s", it was brewed with Flaked Wheat, malted Pilsner and some Flaked Oats in the grist. In true Witbier-style, bitter orange peel and coriander were added to the beer at the end of the boil to provide some additional spiciness/fruitiness to the aroma and flavour. Lightly hopped to balance the sweetness, the beer comes in at 5.5% ABV, and is currently on tap at [La Coast Restaurant et Bar](https://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Coast-Restaurant-et-bar/223239781149406) and [Auberge Gabrièle Inn](http://www.aubergegabrieleinn.com/main.html), both of which are located in Shediac.

• Flying Boats should also be releasing their _Dixie Clipper IPA_ on tap in the near future. Continuing with the locally-named theme, Dixie Clipper refers to "one of the planes that flew into Shediac Bay during the 1920-30's as a weekly Pan Am flight from New York to Shediac, then onward to Europe and return", according to brewer/owner Marc Melanson. Hopped (and dry-hopped) predominantly with **Chinook** to 68 IBUs, it weighs in at a moderately-strong 6.5% ABV. Expect notes of both pine and grapefruit in this hoppy ale. And look for two additional new Flying Boats beers (currently TBD) to be served at next Saturday's [Tasting NB](https://www.facebook.com/events/1603537679923680/)!

• [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) has released a special cider this week, _Get with the Beet_. They sourced fresh beet juice from [Real Food Connections](http://www.realfoodconnections.ca/), and added it to the apple cider base before conditioning. The rough juicing allows significant beet character to shine through on both the nose and palate, with a bright red colour highlighting the blend. The ABV is listed as 7.0%, and will be available at their market stalls in [Fredericton](http://frederictonfarmersmarket.ca/), [Kingston](https://www.facebook.com/KingstonFarmersMarketNB), [Saint John](http://www.sjcitymarket.ca/main.html) and [St. Andrews](http://standrewsfarmersmarket.com/), their [Cider House](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Red+Rover+Brewing+Company/@45.950815,-66.68566,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x83c651056a244ac0?sa=X&ei=6EyVVaLLKtCWyASLh6jIAQ&ved=0CHUQ_BIwCg) and on tap at select locations.

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is releasing a new beer today, _Seaport Blonde_. Brewed in celebration of the spot where they work and play, this American Blonde Ale is light bodied, and has a dry, crisp finish. It features an ABV of 4.0%, from the 2-Row and Wheat malt grain bill, and is lightly hopped with **Columbus** to 8 IBUs. This new brew is on tap and in bottles at the brewery now, and will be debuting in the NSLCs very shortly.

• There's another beer event coming soon to Fredericton from those behind the [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) and the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/). **Ice Cream n' Beer** will be held at the KSAH on Sunday, July 26th from 6-9 pm, and will feature six different local craft beers (8 oz pours) paired with six different "craft ice creams" created by chef Aaron Fraser.  The brewery/beer list will be confirmed once the ice cream creations come in! Tickets are $35 (taxes and fee included) and can be purchased now, [online](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ice-cream-n-beer-tickets-17604806450).

• [Yellowbelly](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) Brewmaster Liam McKenna has put a different spin on the latest batch of their _YellowBelly Pale Ale_, on now at the brewery. The grain bill is the same, for 4.5% ABV, however McKenna has swapped out the traditional **Nugget** and **Cluster** hops used normally in this year-round staple. In their place, **Sorachi Ace** was used for the bittering and flavour additions, with a charge of **Mosaic** used for dry-hopping, for an aromatic blast. This is truly a one-off iteration of the Pale Ale, so be sure to check it out at the brewery today.

• [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) has made progress with their bottling plans, as you should be able to buy their _Summer Sessions IPA_ (a single-malt and single-hop - or SMaSH - beer featuring the **Citra** variety) and _Grapefruit Pale Ale_ in 500 mL bottles at the brewery by next weekend, according to brewer/owner Mitch Biggar. They've been brewing a lot of fruit-based beers for the warmer weather, all of which have their standard Pale Ale as a base, but with different organic brewer's fruit extract and real peel/flesh added. Variations so far have included raspberry, watermelon, black currant, and mango, in addition to the rebrewed grapefruit version; they all measure 5.5% ABV. Right now, they're planning on having bottles at various ANBL locations sometime next month. In the meantime, Railcar beers are also on tap at the [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/FoodatTheCrownDowntown) and [Isaac's Way](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Isaacs-Way-Restaurant/106892732679079?fref=ts) in Fredericton, [A.C. Sharkey's Pub](https://www.facebook.com/acsharkeyspub?fref=ts) in Bristol, and [Larlee Creek Public House](https://www.facebook.com/LarleeCreekPublicHouse?fref=ts) in Perth.

• We have some more details on the new _English Pale Ale_ released in mid-June at the official opening of the [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery) taproom. This golden-amber-coloured ale was brewed with the English pale malt Maris Otter, along with some Crystal malt for both colour and caramel/toffee notes. Hopped to about 50 IBUs with **Goldings** and **Galena**, it weighs in at 6% ABV. It's currently available at the brewery for pints and growler fills, and at the James Joyce in Fredericton.

• For Charlottetown residents, it just got easier to get your hands on [BarNone](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) beer! Last Saturday, they made their first appearance at the [Charlottetown Farmers Market](http://charlottetownfarmersmarket.weebly.com/), where they were selling growlers of their beer. Despite the minimal announcement, locals were quick to snatch up plenty of growlers; for those of you who were unaware, BarNone will return tomorrow morning, and weekly thereafter! Tomorrow's offerings should include their _IPA_ and _La Vaca Loca_ Sweet Stout, and perhaps their _FarmAle Saison_, depending on availability.

• [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/)'s first Food Truck Friday was a grand success last week, despite the poor weather. Today looks to be a little nicer, and the folks from [Free Range Bio Farm](http://www.free-range-bio-farm.com/) will be back with their bright yellow food truck. They will be serving up Bratwurst, Schnitzel and Pulled Pork Sandwiches, with potato salad and sauerkraut. To wash all of that down, grab some of the second release of _The_ S_ilver Tart_ (Sour Raspberry Wheat), the return of _Spin Me White Round_ Wheat IPA, _Tim's Dirty_ American IPA, and _Bitter Get'er India_ Black IPA. Accompanying the food and drinks will be entertainment from local musicians Ferris and Shauna Matthews Asaph.

• After a very successful launch on Saturday, [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) have announced details of their official Launch Party, taking place July 18th at [Flavor on the Water](http://cbflavor.com/water/). An event full of food, music, and of course, beer will run 5:30-1am that night. Four bands will be playing that evening, [Keith Mullins](http://keithmullins.ca/), [Jordan Musycsyn](http://jordanmusycsyn.com/), [Pretty Archie](http://prettyarchie.com/), and [Slowcoaster](http://slowcoaster.co/). Tickets to the event are $30 (which includes a free Breton beer), with a VIP option for $60 which also includes free hors d'oeuvres throughout the evening (including PA Marinated Pulled Pork Sliders, Hefeweizen Marinated Fish Tacos, and Breton Brewing Bold BBQ & Local Maple Jumbo Wings). Tickets can be purchased at the brewery, or [online](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/breton-brewing-launch-party-tickets-17600930858).

• And speaking of Breton, they will be filling growlers at their [Keltic Dr](https://www.google.com/maps/place/364+Keltic+Dr,+Sydney,+NS+B1R+1V7,+Canada/@46.119256,-60.232343,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4b67fb01bed49a87:0x10aa6086844c2f51) location again tomorrow, 10-5pm. Joining their _Stirling_ Hefeweizen and _Black Angus_ IPA on tap will be their _Sons of Hector,_ a 5.0% ABV, 30 IBU Brown Ale. Before their tasting room opens later this month, their brews can be found at [Flavor on the Water](http://cbflavor.com/water/), [Governor's Pub](http://governorseatery.com/), [Iona Heights Inn](http://www.ionaheightsinn.com/), [Old Triangle](http://www.oldtrianglesydneyns.com/welcome/), and [Talo Cafe](http://talocafebar.com/) in Cape Breton, and in Halifax at [The Argyle](http://theargyle.ca/), [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) (both Barrington and the Beer Garden), [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/halifax/), and [Tom's Little Havana](http://tomslittlehavana.wix.com/cafe). Keep an eye on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bretonbrewing) for updates on their opening hours, as they may vary until their tap room is open.

• [Upstreet Brewing](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) opened their doors Friday evening, and have been going great guns ever since. All three of their beers, _Rhuby Social_ Strawberry Rhubarb Wit, _Do-Gooder_ Pale Ale and _Commons_ Pilsner are now available at the brewery tap room for pints and growler fills. They can also be found on tap at several spots in Charlottetown, including [Baba's Lounge](http://www.cedarseatery.com/babamain.html), where they are hosting tonight's Quittin' Time Sessions at 6-8pm, and at tomorrow's [Village Feast](http://villagefeast.ca/Home.html) in Souris, hosted by Chef Michael Smith.

• Do you have any wild hops growing on your property, or have spotted some on the side of the road? If so, [AgCan PEI](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/science-and-innovation/research-centres/atlantic-provinces/crops-and-livestock-research-centre/?id=1180557429228) researchers Aaron Mills and Jason McCallum want to hear about them! They are looking for truly Maritime hop varietals (either native, or from early crops brought from Europe) that are resistant to pests and mildew in our area, and may possibly have some unique flavour and aroma characteristics. If you have any leads, [email Aaron Mills](mailto:Aaron.Mills@agr.gc.ca).

• And finally this week, [Rare Bird](http://www.rarebirdbeer.com/) has released their _Spruce Ale_ seasonal beer this week at their Guysborough brewery. Black Spruce buds were added to the boil, to complement the medium-bodied beer's flavour and aroma. This 5.5% ABV and 53 IBU beer will also be bottled, and should be showing up in the private beer stores in HRM shortly.

Looks like a nice weekend coming up, be sure to enjoy it with some local craft beer! If you're in Fredericton, [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) has released a new iteration of their _Raspberry Wheat_; in addition to fresh raspberries, _Raspberry Pomegranate_ has had - you guessed it - pure pomegranate organic juice added during secondary fermentation. Look for it on tap at the KSAH and [540 Kitchen & Bar](https://www.facebook.com/540kitchenandbar). [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/)'s IPA, _Soeur Catherine_, should now be available in bottles at several [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/ProductDetails/4651) stores across the province, with more locations following soon. Also check out their _Tante Blanche_ on all four growler stations, and [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery)'s _Hawaiian Pale Ale_ is on at [Kennebcasis Valley](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Stores?StoreSearch=Kennebecasis+Valley), but get there soon, as half of the kegs were sold by closing time yesterday! Drop by [Rudder's Brewery & Restaurant](http://www.ruddersbrewpub.com/) in Yarmouth for a taste of their new _Lighthouse Lager_, a 4.3% ABV Australian-style lager, hopped with **Southern Cross** hops. And finally, good news for those of us unable to make it to [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co/301456876447) for the release of their May collaboration brew, _La Gaboteuse II_, with [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301) - a few kegs of this Belgian IPA were saved and will be making their way to the [Tide and Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) in Moncton, and the James Joyce in Fredericton very soon. Be sure to try it if you can, it'll be gone in record time!
