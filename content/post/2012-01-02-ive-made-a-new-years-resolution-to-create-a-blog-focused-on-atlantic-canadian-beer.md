<!--more-->...so here it is.  I can now say I've actually followed through on a resolution...

I love beer.  I love how a few simple ingredients can be mixed and matched to create such unique and delicious taste.  I love the anticipation of trying a new beer and the resulting joyride to my senses.  I also find the beer industry fascinating.  It is one of the very few in existence where there is a genuine comradery in the industry and in many cases a [willingness to collaborate.](http://www.canadianbeernews.com/2011/12/12/hart-thistle-and-propeller-announce-collaboration-beer/)

Why a blog with a primary focus on Atlantic Canada?   What Atlantic Canada lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality.  Atlantic Canada has been very well represented in both national and international beer awards.  From 2005 to 2011, an Atlantic Canada Brewery has won Canadian Brewery of the year twice (Pumphouse Brewery in 2005 and Picaroons in 2011) and Beer of the year twice as well (Garrison Imperial I.P.A. in both 2007 and 2008) at the [Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/).  On the international scene Propeller Brewery has won Gold Medals at the [World Beer Championships](http://www.tastings.com/2011_World_Beer_Championships.html) for four of its brews (Extra Special Bitter, I.P.A., Pale Ale and London-Style Porter) and Garrison has also done well with Gold Medals for both its Imperial I.P.A. and Irish Red Ale.   The number of microbreweries also continues to grow and is a trend I hope to see continue!

If you're wondering, I am not affiliated with any company in the beer industry.  The only revenue I can potentially make with this site is a few bucks off of any books purchased from a link on this site.  I'm hoping within a year or so to cover the cost of a six pack.

If you have any suggestions for topics to cover or how the blog can be better let me know by clicking on the contact page of this site or emailing me at ACBeerBlog@gmail.com.  Also, if you have any news (beer events, new products, etc.) you’d like to have mentioned on the blog please send along  specifics.  As this is a hobby, I hope to consistently have at least 2 to 3 posts per week after an initial rush to put together some "inventory".

Thanks for checking this out and hope to see you back soon!
