Happy Friday and Valentine's Day to everyone! We've got another busy week's worth of beer news from our area, so grab a pint and your sweetie, and enjoy.

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is doing a special event/tasting today, and you can take part! You may have seen the flurry of [#3447](https://twitter.com/search?q=%233447&src=hash) or [#TestBatch](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TestBatch&src=hash) hashtags on Twitter, this is it: Brewmaster Daniel Girard is putting out a small batch of a new IPA, and they want you to give them feedback. From 4-5:30 today, the new beer will be available at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/), [Lion & Bright](https://www.facebook.com/lionandbright), [HMCS King's Wardroom](https://www.facebook.com/KingsWardroom) and the brewery. Garrison crew will be sharing samples of the new beer, in order to get your feedback. Tracy Philippi of Garrison shared some recipe details with us: It clocks in at 51 IBUs and 6.5% ABV, and is a very tropical IPA with hops like Cascade & Citra. Be sure to drop by & let them know what you think! Psst… you could even win a prize for your feedback! The Test Batch will also be available in 650 ml bombers at their retail store, as well as the four private beer stores in HRM.

• Garrison brewer Kellye Robertson had a crazy idea for a Valentine's Day beer, so the crew has brewed it up, and we all get to enjoy it: Love Potion #9. The base of this elixir is an amber ale (4.6% and 21 IBUs), but it is infused with cranberries & hibiscus, among other cheeky ingredients. It will also be available for growler fills at Garrison today, and will also appear on tap around Halifax (Kings Ward Room, Dalhousie Grad House, Mothers Pizza, Freeman’s Quinpool, Wooden Monkey (Halifax), Lion and Bright, Stillwell, Stubborn Goat and The Argyle).

• Good news for our Garrison fans on The Rock! Their Spruce Beer has hit the shelves across the province. Check out the [NLC page](http://www.nlliquor.com/products/14621/Garrison%20Spruce%20Beer%20500ml%20Bottle) for availability close to you. Tracy has let us know that this is only the first of many Garrison beers that they'll be sending to Newfoundland, so keep your eyes and ears open for that, likely in the spring.

• Even more Garrison news, their very popular Grand Baltic Porter was brewed earlier this week. We don't have all of the details yet, but previous years' batches have weighed in around 9%, and the style is very rich with chocolate and roast characters. This is a bigger beer, so the turnaround is usually a bit longer, so the release will probably be early- to-mid-March.

• And finally in Garrison news, a final reminder that entries for the Home Brew-off are due Thursday, Feb 20th. As we've mentioned previously, there has been a big improvement to the judging, in that the first round of judging will be done by BJCP-certified judges, and every entrant will receive a full scoresheet back (rather than just the final four). The gala will be taking place March 13th at the brewery, where the top four beers will be sampled, and last year's winning Belgian Blonde will be released. It's always a great time!

• The winning beer brewed by Joe Goodine of Moncton for the 1st Annual New Brunswick Home-Brew Challenge will soon be on tap in Fredericton. This beer, a [Standard/Ordinary Bitter](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style08.php#1a), was selected out of 42 entries for the style as the winner at a gala at the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) in December. Joe brewed the beer at [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) with their head brewer, Andrew Estabrooks. While details of the beer are slim, look for it on tap for growler fills at the [Brewtique](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Picaroons-Brewtique/175733285789133?ref=br_tf), and possibly at Marky's Laundromat in Moncton. You can read more on the contest and gala in our [previous post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/06/friday-wrap-up-20131206/).

• Due to the popularity of the Ember Ale (a smoked Porter) brewed by Picaroons for the opening of the King Street Ale House last November, they've decided to brew the beer again! While it was originally for exclusive sale at the KSAH, it will be also be available on tap elsewhere, and at the Brewtique for growler fills.

• And, in other returning-beers-from-Picaroons news, look for their Maple Cream Ale to hit shelves/taps around March 1st. Keep following this blog for news on a launch party for that date; also, stay tuned to Picaroon's [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/picaroons) for updates as well.

• Over in PEI, the [Gahan House](http://www.gahan.ca/) has decided to connect with local homebrewers by holding the 1st Annual Home Brewer's Challenge. Residents of PEI that are 19 and older are invited to submit a home brewed beer of their own for a chance to brew a full-sized batch of their beer with brewmaster Trent Hayes, to be released on tap as a Gahan seasonal! The beer must be brewed as an all-grain beer (no kits or extract allowed), and the style "must complement the regular line-up of Gahan beers". There is no charge to enter; just fill out the registration and recipe sheets provided, and send in a 6-pack of your beer to the Gahan House (125 Sydney St., Charlottetown) by 5:00 pm, Friday, March 21st. The judges (including Hayes, another brewer, and others TBD) will narrow the beers down to the top 5; these will then be tasted live on a local radio station over that next week, Monday to Friday, with a different beer featured each day. Finally, on Saturday at Gahan House, there will be a 2:00 pm tasting panel to select the winner. Entrants will be invited to join the event to watch the proceedings. If you want to sign up, send an email to [gahan@murphysrestaurants.ca](mailto:gahan<at>murphysrestaurants.ca), and they'll get the forms to you; the deadline to sign up is one week from today, Feb. 21st. Get brewing, Islanders!

• PEI's other brewery has some news: [Barnone Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) is now offering a new growler for purchase to fill with their three regular beers. This [Hydroflask](http://www.hydroflask.com/) growler is becoming quite popular; made of durable, food-grade stainless steel, it's capable of keeping beer (and other liquids, of course) cold for up to 24 hours. It's your typical 1.89 L (64 oz) growler size, and can be purchased for $50 at the brewery. Pick one up during their weekly growler night - Thursdays from 6-8 pm - and fill it with either the Summer Sessions, Pale Ale, or IPA.

• Speaking of Barnone, they've added a new account to their growing list in Charlottetown. [The Olde Dublin Pub](http://www.oldedublinpub.com/) on Sydney Street will now be serving Barnone's Pale Ale.

• The [Antigonish Townhouse](http://antigonishtownhouse.blogspot.com/) is going on hiatus for awhile - the brewpub is closing for a mid-winter break from Feb 17th to March 3rd. After allowing their staff this period of rejuvenation, they plan on being back better than ever, with fresh beer and food flowing! Check out their announcement [here](http://antigonishtownhouse.blogspot.ca/2014/02/mid-winter-break.html). Terry has brewed up a Northern English Brown for sale at the pub, to complement the Bitter, so be sure to try that next time you're in.

• [Bridge Brewing Co.](http://bridgebeer.ca/) in Halifax has recently changed their name to North Brewing Co. According to owner Peter Burbridge, this was done to avoid confusion with [Bridge Brewing Co.](http://www.bridgebrewing.com/) in Vancouver, B.C.: "... we felt it was best to claim a name that was all our own. North is such a strong word with a lot of meaning for us. We brew and sell our beer in the North End of Halifax and we also have a strong sense of the direction we want to take North Brewing Company and so the word 'North' really resonates with us." The brewery has graciously offered to exchange any Bridge merchandise for newer North merchandise; or, you can choose to keep the Bridge swag as collector's items! The very popular brewery is currently undergoing an expansion... look for them to soon double and then quadruple their capacity!

• A few weeks ago, the crew from Stillwell Beer Bar made a visit to [Bad Apple Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/badapplebrewhouse) in Somerset, and brewed up a batch of beer with Brewmaster Jeff Saunders. A little birdie has told me the beer should be available starting this weekend, on tap only at Stillwell. You'll have to keep your eyes peeled to their twitter feeds (@[BadAppleBrewing](https://twitter.com/BadAppleBrewing) and [@BarStillwell](https://twitter.com/BarStillwell)), as you don't want to miss this little stunner!

• [Rogues Roost Brewpub](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) in Halifax is getting ready to release a [Bock](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style05.php#1b) in the next week or so. Brewer Jake gave us an insight into the recipe: It was brewed with a Munich malt base with a bit of Vienna; also Melanoidin, Cara 80, and a touch of Black malt. Bittered with mostly Tettnanger hops, O.G. 1.068 F.G. 1.016, for an ABV of 6.8%. Jake also let us know that he's got a Pilsner in the works as well. It is a [Czech Pils](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style02.php#1b) insofar as water and gravity (soft water with low mineral content, ABV around 4.5-5%) are concerned, but hopped using [Hersbrucker](http://beerlegends.com/hersbrucker-hops) (a German hop as opposed to Czech Saaz),  because, as Jake put it, "Hersbruckers are awesome". Sounds like a good enough reason to us!

• The [Beerthief](http://www.beerthief.ca/) Newfoundland and Labrador Artisanal and Craft Beer Club have published a [Club Status Report](http://www.beerthief.ca/general-news/club-status-report-feb-10-2014) this week, giving details on their membership base, current and upcoming beer offerings. With over 2400 all across Newfoundland and Labrador, they are having a measurable impact on the beers offered and available at the [NLC](http://www.nlliquor.com/). The province has recognized that the local beer lovers were being under-served, and by partnering with Mike and Tom of the Club, are making changes to the selection. We encourage you to read the report to get an idea of how YOU can influence the beer selection in your neck of the woods. Congratulations!

• Chris had a great time at the [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/) last night, celebrating the launch of [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery). Despite the poor weather, the restaurant was packed with folks trying (and then buying) Shane's four beers. SJAH will have two Hammond River beers on permanently, and the beers can also be found at the [Bourbon Quarter](http://www.bourbonquartersj.com/), [The Barrel's Head](http://www.thebarrelshead.com/), and [Shiretown Publicans](https://www.facebook.com/ShiretownPublicans). Shane was also featured in a few interviews this wee; go check them out for more information on HRB: [SJAH TV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-X98qViAc), [CBC Information Morning](http://www.cbc.ca/informationmorningsaintjohn/2014/02/03/hampton-basement-brewery-hits-restaurants-next-week/), [CBC TV](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/quispamsis-man-brews-new-business-in-his-basement-1.2530287). Congratulations once again, Shane!

• The [Moncton Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/MonctonBeerLeague) is having their first event at the [Pump House Brewery](http://www.pumphousebrewery.ca/) (131 Mill Rd.) next Friday, Feb. 21st. The first meeting will include a brewery tour of the Pump House, followed by tasting samples of five beers on tap, plus a special barrel-aged or cask-conditioned beer brewed specifically for the League. Tickets can be bought in advance [here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/pumphouse-brewery-tour-tickets-10522359661) for $15 per person, or purchased at the door for $20 when the event begins. It all begins at 7 pm, and should continue until 10 pm.

• And, to close things off, just a quick note to officially welcome [The Pub Magazine - Atlantic Canadian Edition](http://www.thepubmagazine.com/) to the beer world! They've been very active over the past few months on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThePubMagazine) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thepubmagazine), but just published their first edition [online](http://issuu.com/thepubmagazine/docs/issue__1_feb__2014_web_version) a few days ago (and the magazine will be in your favourite pub and bar soon). We look forward to seeing what Troy and company do next!

That's it for now, you bunch of romantics... see you next week!
