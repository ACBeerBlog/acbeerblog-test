_Updated March 15th 9:48pm- I've updated this post based on feedback from Peter Burbridge (second and third sentences).  He clarified that he is not looking for a brewmaster and that he already has a consultant lined up to help transition from home brewing to commercial scale._

As noted [in the Coast](http://www.thecoast.ca/RestaurantandBarNews/archives/2012/03/14/another-brewery-for-halifax), a new brewery is being planned for Halifax.  The 'nanobrewery' is being opened by Peter Burbridge who will be doing the brewing for the new company.  Peter also has a consultant lined up to help transition from home brewing to commercial scale production.

As per the [brewery's website](http://www.bridgebeer.ca/), its initial offering will be Yardstick Ale which is described as "a Belgian abbey style ale with a North American twist".

Another interesting element to the brewery is that it is aiming to be a[ zero emission brewery](http://www.bridgebeer.ca/zero-emissions/).   The intent is to [divert waste streams from landfills to create new products](http://www.bridgebeer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/zeridrawing1.gif).  The website also has [a sustainability blog](http://www.bridgebeer.ca/sustainability-blog/) outlining how they aim to operate their business in the most environmentally friendly way possible while still remaining economically viable.

You can also follow the new brewery on Twitter @Bridgebeer and based on their initial tweet in January it looks like they are targeting a July opening date.

I'll post more information as it becomes available.
