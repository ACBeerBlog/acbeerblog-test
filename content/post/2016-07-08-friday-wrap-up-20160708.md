Happy Friday! After some great weather on the Canada Day weekend, we are back to the reality of Atlantic Canadian weather, so best to grab a growler, can or bottle, and stay inside to read the latest beer news from our region.

• [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) released a new fruit cider earlier this week - _Dragon Slayer_ is named after Saint George, well-known for his [dragon-slaying abilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon) and Targaryen-thwarting. The cider was co-fermented with locally-sourced cranberries, giving it a crimson hue. Subtly sharp and rather tannic, as described by the cidery, it finishes quite dry and weighs in at 7% ABV. It's available at the Cider House and farmers' markets for growler fills, and should be on tap at a few select bars/restaurants in New Brunswick, including [540 Kitchen & Bar](https://www.facebook.com/540kitchenandbar) and [Snooty Fox](http://thesnooty.ca/) in Fredericton, and [Ducky's](https://www.facebook.com/duckysbar) in Sackville.

• [Gahan House - Charlottetown](http://charlottetown.gahan.ca/) has taken their Belgian Blonde Ale, _Belgium Blue_, and tweaked it a bit for some lucky New Brunswick beer drinkers! They added a special roast of local [Receiver Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/receivercoffeeco/) sourced from Tomila, Columbia, resulting in _Coffee Belgian Blonde_. The coffee is described by [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) brewmaster Chris Long as "juicy, acidic, and fruity, with a mild chocolate flavour". The original beer is light enough to let the coffee flavours shine through, "but complex enough to enhance the amazing aromas of this particular batch". Clocking in at ~7.5% ABV, it's available at all five [ANBL growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) stations this weekend. If you're in Charlottetown and feeling left out, fear not - a couple of kegs were also sent to [HopYard](https://www.facebook.com/hopyardbeerbar/?fref=ts).

• And in other PEIBC news, the brewery has installed a used 7 BBL (~800 L) fermentor that will serve a dual purpose: growing up different yeast strains for seasonal batches, and for experimenting! Look for several new beers to be test-brewed over the coming weeks, including a dry-hopped version (with **Ella** and **El Dorado**) of their _Sir John A's Honey Wheat_, a double-dry-hopped _1772_ (**Cascade** first, then **Simcoe** and **Mosaic**), and a Saison dry-hopped with **Goldings**. And to celebrate their recent four Gold medals at the 2016 [Canadian Brewing Awards](http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/winners/2016-winner-list/), they have released **The Gold Pack** at the [PEILCC](http://www.peilcc.ca/), featuring cans of their _Rogues Roost_ IPA, _Setting Day_ Saison, _Sir John A's_ Honey Wheat, and _Vic Park_ Pale Ale.

• [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) just brewed a new beer last night, and it's one we're confidant in saying hasn't been attempted in these parts before! _Rum Raisin Belgian Dubbel_ was brewed with a grist of Pilsner, Munich, Special B, Crystal, and Aromatic malts, and lightly hopped to 24 IBUs with **Tettnang**. Eight pounds of raisins were soaked in [Eldorado 12 Rum](http://theeldoradorum.com/), and then pureed and added to the end of the boil, along with plenty of [Chapmans](http://www.chapmans.ca/) vanilla ice cream and dark Belgian Candi Syrup. Wait, there's more - Madagascar vanilla beans will also be added during secondary fermentation. The targeted ABV is 7.1%, and on top of everything else, some of the beer may end up being barrel-aged! Look for the beer to be released over the next few weeks; we'll keep you updated!

• [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) just canned and released their _Cellar Slammer ISA_, a new Session IPA brewed with the crew from [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) in Halifax. Hopped with **Mosaic**, **Hallertau Blanc** and a small addition of **Amarillo**, look for lots of tropical fruit aromas and flavours in this 4.7% ABV summer sipper. It is available in growlers and cans at the brewery, and in cans at Bishop's Cellar now.

• [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) has recently re-released two hoppy ales that they haven't had out for awhile. First up is their American IPA, _Hugh John Hops_; heavily hopped (with **Mosaic** in particular) to come in "dank, fruity and piney", it comes in at 6.8% ABV. Next is the return of _Patio_ for the first time since its initial release last summer. An American Wheat Ale hopped entirely with **Topaz** - with almost all of it being added at flameout and the dry-hop, to give a huge blast of tangerine and citrus, without a lot of bitterness - it's very sessionable at 4.7% ABV. Both beers are available now for pints and growler fills at the brewery, as well as on tap at select accounts across Fredericton.

• [FirkinStein Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/FirkinStein-Brewing/754150891380564) just released a new beer yesterday at the [Lunenburg Farmers' Market](https://www.facebook.com/Lunenburg-Farmers-Market-130488833651863/), _Anchors Aweigh Pale Ale_. Described by the brewery as "light and refreshing, with a crisp, mild hoppy taste, and mild bitterness in the finish", it weighs in at 6% ABV. It should be available at tomorrow's [Bridgewater Farmers' Market](http://bridgewaterfarmersmarket.ca/) in growlers and grunters, with 500 mL bottles  following next week. They will also be attending **tomorrow's** [Food Truck Rally](http://hubbardsbarn.org/hubbards-barn-food-truck-rally-july-9/) at the Hubbards Barn & Community Park, from 4-8pm.

• [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) is bringing out their latest **One Hit Wonder** today, _Citrus Pale Ale_. Brewed with a grist of Pale and Wheat malts, this beer features a big citrus nose and flavour, thanks to generous addition of Curaçao orange peel and **Ahtanum **hops added during the whirlpool phase (after boiling is complete). **Cascade** and **Centennial** hops help to balance the malt, with the final beer details coming in at 5.8% ABV and a light 25 IBUs. The beer will be available on tap and in growlers at the Gottingen location this afternoon (drop by after work), and on Windmill later this evening, or first thing tomorrow. As always, a few of these **OHW**_ _kegs do make it into the wild at select bars, so if you spot it, grab a pint!

• Halifax's [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) has teamed up with Falmouth's [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/) to release a special beer ahead of this weekend's [Evolve Festival](http://www.evolvefestival.com/). _Skratch Plaskett - Electric Tambourine Ale_ is a light-bodied 5.8% ABV Pale Ale, featuring a set of American and Australian hops: **Warrior** for bittering (contributing to most of the 25 IBUs), **Cascade** in the whirlpool for some flavour and aroma, and **Summer** as a dry hop for an Aussie aroma of stone, tropical, and citrus fruits. _Skratch Plaskett_ is the result of 8 test batches and iterations, as the characteristics were honed in on their desired recipe for a crushable beer with lots of character. Much like the name implies, it is a true collaboration of a beer! The beer will be available at the Evolve Festival (happening near Moncton), as well as on tap/growlers at Good Robot and Schoolhouse's market location shortly.

• And in more Good Robot news, keep your eyes peeled for the return of _The Shocking Pink_, their Gose blended with pink lemonade and hibiscus tea, as well as_ Burban Legend_ American Pale Ale v6.0, dry-hopped with currently-unnamed experimental hop **342** from [Hop Breeding Company](http://www.hopbreeding.com/). This hop lends a floral, citrus, and melon characters to the beer. And for those loved, or missed and wanted to try, the New Zealand IPA **Beta Brew** that debuted at the Tap Room this week, the single keg is all gone, but will be returning in another iteration soon.

• [Maybee Brewing](http://www.maybeebrew.com/) has started canning another of their flagship beers - _Stone House Tripel_ is now available in 500 mL cans for purchase at the brewery in Fredericton; they also should be for sale at the [Picaroons General Store](https://www.facebook.com/PicarooonsGeneralStore/?fref=ts) in Saint John by sometime next week. Also note that Maybee recently doubled their number of taps to 12, which means more new beers in the future, as well as several taps dedicated to other NB breweries for taproom purchase.

• [Unfiltered](http://hoppyasballs.ca) has released another batch of _Front Line Rocker_, their 8% Double IPA brewed with the famous Conan yeast. It's back on tap at the brewery and Charm School, at noon and 4pm today, respectively, and will be delivered to local bars very shortly. Be sure to drop by Charm School **tomorrow** afternoon for an [Indochine](http://indochine.ca/) Bahn Mi pop-up. Featuring Pork Belly marinated in Unfiltered's _Flat Black Jesus_ American Stout, they will be serving from 4-9pm (assuming the tasty treats last that long)

• Congratulations to the winners at last weekend's [Newfermenters](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Newfermenters/) Brew-Off! Bill Burton took Best-in-Show out of the 25 submissions, and will have a chance to brew his winning recipe with the crew at [Port Rexton](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) later in the summer. And speaking of which, PR has brewed the first beers on their new system, and are aiming to open in the next month or so!

As for what's going on in the events section over the coming days and weeks...

• [Annapolis Cider Company](http://drinkannapolis.ca/) is throwing their grand opening party this weekend **(Friday to Sunday)**, and to help celebrate, they'll be offering tasting paddles - three 3 oz pours - of their three currently-available ciders for only $3. They'll also be giving free tours of the cider cellar all three days, at 11 am, 2 pm and 4 pm.

• A final reminder that the second annual [Tasting NB](https://www.facebook.com/events/1745077322415797/) event happens **tomorrow (Saturday, July 9th)** in Fredericton at the [Capital Complex](http://www.thecapitalcomplex.com/), from 7-10 pm. Featuring 17 different producers of beer, cider, mead, spirits, and wine, your $55 ticket (if [purchased in advance](https://etixnow.com/events/tasting-nb-2016/jul-9-2016/the-capital-complex); $60 at the door) gets you unlimited samples for the evening.

• The [Moncton Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/MonctonBeerLeague) is holding their second [Urban Beer Hike](https://www.facebook.com/events/131934050551477/) on **Saturday, July 23rd**. The downtown walking tour will begin at [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/) at 1:45 pm, with several stops at various craft beer destinations in the city, before finishing at the [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) brewpub around 5:30 pm.

• It's a few months away, but the date has been announced for the 2nd Annual [Fredericton Cider Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/232750247078084/): **Saturday, October 1st**, on the [Brewbakers](http://brewbakers.ca/) covered patio.

Both local and larger cideries will be pouring, with over 25 different types likely to be available to sample.

A few more notes before signing off this week:

- [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) has re-released their _Meek Thy Maker_, a Red IPA hopped with **Amarillo**, **Columbus** and** Citra** (which is replacing **Cascade** this time around). It's on tap at the brewery now, with growlers available at supplied Farmers' Markets, and many tap accounts in Nova Scotia.
- [Railcar](http://railcarbrewing.com/) has brewed up another batch of their_ Smoked Molasses Porter_; it's available now at the brewery, and will be hitting the Fredericton ANBL growler station (Prospect St.) at the end of the month.
- [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/) brewed up a SMaSH beer yesterday, featuring ingredient sourced nearby: Pale malt from [Malt-Broue](http://www.maltbroue.com/en/) South-East Quebec and **Cascade** hops from nearby [Aroostook Hop](http://www.aroostookhops.com/) in Northern Maine. Look for it to hit the taps at the end of July.

Despite the weather, enjoy your weekend! In closing, [Atlantic Business Magazine](http://www.atlanticbusinessmagazine.net/) is running an [online poll](http://www.atlanticbusinessmagazine.net/beer-buzz-2/) where you can vote for your favourite Atlantic Canadian brewery; it runs until July 29th, and the winner will be featured in the September edition of the magazine.
