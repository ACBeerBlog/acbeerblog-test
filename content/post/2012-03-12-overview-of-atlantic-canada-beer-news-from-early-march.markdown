I'm just getting back from vacation and want to get caught up on recent Atlantic Canadian beer news.  Here's an overview of links to recent news:

Quidi Vidi Brewing Company:  Check out [this link](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/02/29/147581630/newfoundland-gives-whole-new-meaning-to-ice-cold-beer) ([and this related one](http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/iceberg-beer-makes-distinctive-newfoundland-brew-011443410.html)) to learn more about a special ingredient they use in their beer.
