[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/monster-mash-collaboration.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/monster-mash-collaboration.jpg)As noted on the [Picaroons Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/picaroons), Picaroons and new brewery Grimross Brewing have combined to create Monster Mash-Up Collaboration Ale.  The brew was created by Picaroons' head brewer Andrew “Esty” Estabrooks and Stephen Dixon, owner of Grimross Brewing and as explained in the post brings Stephen's Belgian influence to Picaroons' British-style ales.  The brew is available on tap at the Brewtique and is described as:


<blockquote>A bit of a monster, coming in at around 8% alc./vol. - This ale is similar to a barley wine, with the added spiciness of a Belgian yeast.</blockquote>


The post goes on to explain that Stephen will be brewing on the Brewtique system as he develops the recipes that will eventually be produced by his new brewery. More of his beer is expected at the Brewtique in the future.

I haven't been able to track down much other information on Grimross Brewing other than they can be followed on Twitter ( @GrimrossBrewing ) and that they have just created a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307?ref=ts&fref=ts) earlier today.  I will post more information on the new brewery as it is available.
