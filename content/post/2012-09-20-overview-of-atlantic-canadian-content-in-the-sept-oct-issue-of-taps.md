I'm a little late providing an overview of local content in the latest issue of TAPS.  I've been in Montreal the past few days and the new issue only arrived in my mailbox after I left.  Speaking of Montreal, next time you're there run, don't walk, to Dieu du Ciel and pray they still have some of their Hemelse God left.  This is an outstanding collaboration Sour Ale made with New Belgium Brewery of Colorado.  I digress.

As usual, there is lots of Maritime content in the latest issue of TAPS.  In the Bar Snacks section the is reference to new craft breweries expected to appear in N.S. over the next year including a new brewing company expected to open soon on the South Shore.  There is also news related to Bride Brewing, the Townhouse Brewpub in Antigonish and Garrison Brewing.

New Brunswick's Craig Pinhey has a feature article on P.E.I.'s DME, a manufacturer of brewing equipment.  Pinhey also has an article about pumpkin beer in the issue.

Tasting notes on P.E.I. Brewing Co.'s Iron Horse Brown Ale are included in the tasting panel written by Pinhey and Propeller's Tracy Phillipi.
