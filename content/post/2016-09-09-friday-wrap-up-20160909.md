Happy Friday, everyone! Here's hoping that you're all fully recovered from the beautiful Labour Day weekend we just had; as usual, the local beer news just keeps on truckin'...

• There's a new beer on tap at [Nine Locks](http://www.ninelocksbrewing.ca) - _Cream Ale_ is a special one-off brewed just in time for the end of summer. This amber-coloured brew is "smooth and full-bodied", according to the brewery, featuring caramel notes and a "subtle hop finish" provided by the two English varieties, **East Kent Goldings** and **Fuggles**. At 15 IBUs, the beer finishes only mildly bitter, and is quite easy-drinking at 5.2% ABV. No cans for this one - it's available only on tap at the brewery for growler fills, until it's gone!

• [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released their latest One Hit Wonder, _Tea Rex Ale_. Described as an unfiltered Black Tea-Infused Ale, the beer was infused with organic Assam black tea from [DAVIDsTEA](https://www.davidstea.com/), and then further dry-hopped (dry-tead?) with it. Black in colour, with a creamy brown head, the beer was hopped with **Ahtanum** to 47 IBUs; the hop also provides "bright, distinct notes" in the flavour, to go with the molasses undertones. At 6% ABV, the brewery is describing it as "smooth and approachable"; they also recommend drinking this beer from a tea cup! As with all OHW beers, it's available on tap at both Prop Shop locations for growler fills, and it will likely appear at select beer establishments in the HRM.

• [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) has a brand new cider that will be released next Wednesday, created specifically for local restaurant/bar [The Snooty Fox](http://thesnooty.ca/). Made with wild blueberries and tart cherry juice, this 7% ABV cider will be on tap exclusively at the Snooty in celebration of the annual [Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival](http://www.harvestjazzandblues.com/) beginning next week in Fredericton. They need your help in naming it, however, and are holding a [contest](https://www.facebook.com/Snootyfoxpub/photos/a.340516232687127.74110.123746327697453/1144988838906525/?type=3&theater) with the Snooty, so send in your best name to win some great prizes! The winner will be chosen on Tuesday. And in other Harvest-related cider news, Red Rover will also be re-releasing _The Blues_, a 7% ABV cider made with wild blueberries. This one will be available for flagon fills at the Cider House, and on tap throughout the city; if the response is good (which it definitely was last year), _The Blues_ could be bottled and sold at ANBL stores in the near future.

• As they gear up for the revelry of the [Halifax Oktoberfest](http://hfxoktoberfest.ca/) events later in the month, [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) brings us two fall beers this week: a return engagement and an all new twist on a classic style, both featuring rye. First brewed with [Beau’s All Natural Brewing](http://beaus.ca/) in 2014, the _Sweet Rye’d Harvest Wheat Ale_ features both wheat and rye malts along with Munich and pale in a 6.0% ABV copper-coloured brew. Hopped to 40 IBUs with **Cascade**, **Citra**, and **Columbus**, it also features bog myrtle (_Myrica gale)_ provided by Beau’s. It is available for purchase in six-packs now at the [NSLC](https://www.mynslc.com/en/products/Beer/Ale/Specialty%20Ale/1019685.aspx), and shortly at the [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/ProductDetails/25287).

• New to Garrison’s lineup is a familiar concept to those who appreciate well shots at dive bars. A brew conceived of during this year’s [Seaport Beer Fest](http://seaportbeerfest.com/), _Rye & Ginger IPA_ takes on a Canadian favourite mixed drink in a beer-centric way. Featuring the grainy spiciness of rye malt, the body yields light caramel, toffee, dark fruit and a kick of ginger. The lemon slice on the rim is provided by the citrus punch of **Centennial** hops, which also provide a touch of earthy balance. At 6.4% ABV and 56 IBU, it’s solidly in the sweetspot for modern IPAs. Light-amber and hazy in colour, it has a dry, warming finish that should be perfect for crisp fall evenings. Even better, it provides a chance to toast your university days in a more grown-up and refined way. Find it in 650 mL bombers at NSLC and private NS stores, as well as through the [ANBL growler program](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwikn9_rgYLPAhXGmR4KHSVsArAQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbliquor.com%2Fdocuments%2Fgrowler.pdf&usg=AFQjCNF3vc3DSJqyn4yCB5WpMYBCzu6eVQ&sig2=48bkUhjvlhkuwIv0oK0I1Q&bvm=bv.131783435,d.dmo) this weekend.

•  Digby's [Roof Hound Brewing](http://roofhound.ca/) has been open for a month, and now fans from both near and far can enjoy their beer in a few more venues. This week they launched growler fills at the brewery, allowing patrons to grab a 0.95 or 1.89 L fill of their _Little Pup _Pale Ale, _Rooftop Rye-It_ Rye Amber, _Wasted Days_ Peanut Butter Chocolate Wheat, and newly launched _Big Brown Roof Hound_, the 7.0% ABV Brown Ale with raisins and brown sugar, after which the brewery is named ([full story here](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/02/12/les-barr-masterchef-roof-hound/)). And for those not able to make a visit to the taproom to enjoy the beer, food, and ambiance, owner Les Barr has delivered a few kegs of beer outside of town. Look out for the tapping of _BBRH_ at Dartmouth's [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/), Halifax's [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/), as well as the [Capital Pub in Middleton](http://www.capitolpub.ca/) in the coming days.

• [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) is doing some experimenting at the brewery, as they recently began brewing their first go at a kettle-soured beer. Details are slim at the moment, but we can confirm they pitched a strain of _Lactobacillus_ from [Escarpment labs](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/), with the goal being to sour the wort to the desired level, before boiling and fermenting the beer afterwards. Expect this one to come in at about 5% ABV; we'll release more specifics as they become available.

• [YellowBelly](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) has the third iteration of their _East Coast Cream Ale_ currently pouring at the brewpub in St. John's. Originally a collaboration beer created with Australia's [Top Shed](https://www.facebook.com/thetopshed/), the latest beer is "slightly lighter in body", and was allowed to spend a longer amount of time in secondary, to smooth out the flavours even more than the two previous brews. It comes in at 5% ABV, and should be available in bottles by next Wednesday. In addition, bottles of their _Southern Shore Foggy Porter_ are now available at the brewery, and select St. John's NLC locations.

• [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) has brewed up a new beer at their General Store location in Saint John - _Hippie IPA_ is a 6.3% ABV SMaSH beer featuring Maritime Malt, and **Nugget** hops grown and harvested at Lunahops in Cornhill, NB. Fermented with an American Ale yeast strain, this small batch will be tapped this Sunday, **September 11th** at 3 pm at the General Store (where it will likely be available exclusively, for pints and growler fills); live music from [Earthbound Trio](https://www.facebook.com/earthboundtrio/?fref=ts) will accompany the release. And keep your eyes open for a unique beer brewed with [BioNB](http://bionb.org/) for their **Sept 30th** "Innovation at the Station" event at the York Street Train Station, celebrating 20 years of operation. Tickets are free, but [advance registration](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/innovation-at-the-station-2016-tickets-26723030303) is suggested.

• We also have all the details on this year's release of Picaroons' _Harvest Ale_. A 5.5% ABV "golden amber ale" (British Pale Ale) brewed every year, there are usually three or more batches brewed, each featuring a different hop variety or varieties that is/are grown in Atlantic Canada. For this season, there will be three larger batches: one using all **Mt. Hood** hops from [Wallace Ridge Farm](https://www.facebook.com/Wallace-Ridge-Farm-138211669596965/) (Nova Scotia); one using all **Willamette** from My Father's Farm (PEI); and one using all "wild hops" from [Moose Mountain Hops](http://www.moosemountainhops.com/) (New Brunswick). As always, all the details on the farm and hops used can be found by checking the four-digit code on your bottle, and looking it up [online](http://picaroons.ca/myharvest/). The beer should be released sometime in the next couple of weeks.

• [Spindrift](http://spindriftbrewing.com/) is bringing back _The Abyss_, their Schwarzbier, which will be available in cans next week. The gravity is bumped up slightly to 4.8% ABV after a light tweak to the recipe, and fans of the black and lightly roasted lager will be happy to be able to grab it again. It launches at the brewery Thursday; private stores and NSLC outlets will follow in the near future.

We've got a few events to tell you about this week, and don't forget to check out our [Calendar Page](http://acbeerblog.ca/calendar-of-events/), as we keep it as up-to-date as possible with all of the events going on in the region, including next weekend's Halifax Oktoberfest fun.

• A reminder that the launch of [Trider's Craft Beer](https://www.facebook.com/triderscraftbeerns) is happening tomorrow, **September 10th** at [Sociables Pub](https://www.facebook.com/sociablespubandeatery/) in Springhill. Tickets are still available in advance, or pay on entry at 8pm. Meet the folks behind Trider's, and your first pint is included in the ticket price. Trider's storefront at [46 Anson Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/46+Anson+Ave,+Amherst,+NS+B4H+4R3,+Canada/@45.8120208,-64.2167187,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4b5f49469aac8b75:0xa7d42864813c6f3!8m2!3d45.8120208!4d-64.21453) will be opening **September 16th**, and they will be taking part in the [Rocktoberfest](https://www.facebook.com/events/222877021408898/) at the Amherst Fire Hall **October 1st**.

• **September 10th** also marks the last [Urban Beer Hike](https://urbanbeerhike3.eventbrite.com) lead by the [Moncton Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/MonctonBeerLeague) for a while. Meet at the Laundromat Espresso Bar at 1:45, and visit five spots for food and beer along the way. Tickets are still available, so be sure to check it out!

• For those in PEI (or up for a little drive), be sure to drop by [Upstreet Brewing](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) **tomorrow** for the launch of a brand new beer. _Lager Quest_ came about when an Upstreet fan won a silent auction supporting the Red Cross' efforts in Fort McMurray. Winner Gavin Hall helped pick the style of the brew, was put to work making it with Brewmaster Mike Hogan, and will have the honour of the first pour in the taproom Saturday at 3pm. Drop by for the fun, and there are [more details here.](https://www.facebook.com/events/1661525297496028/)

• The next Moncton Beer League event is **September 24th,** [Atlantic Canadian Craft Brew Oktoberfest](https://accboktoberfest.eventbrite.com), being held at the Lions Club on Mark Avenue. Close to 20 breweries from around the Maritimes will be in attendance, pouring their wares to benefit the United Way. [Tickets are still available](https://accboktoberfest.eventbrite.com)!

• [New Brunswick Beer Tours](https://www.facebook.com/newbrunswickbeertours/?fref=ts) has their next event planned, and it's set up in true festive fashion! The [Christmas Brewery Tour](https://www.facebook.com/events/181936518883153/) is scheduled for **Saturday, December 17th**; it will follow a similar format as in previous tours, with four brewery visits.

[Tickets are available now](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/christmas-brewery-tour-tickets-27565773972?aff=FB), and are $67.50 each.

As a favourite university professor of mine always used to say - that's it, that's all, there ain't no more! Ok, maybe a couple more short things...

- [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/)'s latest release is _Son of a Pitch_, a 7.1% ABV Double IPA. It is available exclusively at the brewery and [Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/). And congratulations to Jeff and Kari on getting hitched in Vegas this week!
- [Maybee Brewing](http://www.maybeebrew.com/)'s _Long Carry Brett Red_, their _Roseway Red_ aged on Brettanomyces, is now available in 750 mL, cork and cage bottles, exclusively at the brewery for now.
- [Port Rexton Brewing](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) has announced their new hours for September, which will see them closed on Wednesdays, and remain open all other days 2-10pm. And they will be gearing down for the season on Saturday, October 29th, so be sure to drop by the brewery in the next 8 weeks to grab a taste of the Bonavista Peninsula!
- [Uncle Leo's](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/) is releasing their _Harvest Ale_ today, brewed with malt from [Horton Ridge Malt](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) and hops from [Bramble Hill Farm](http://www.bramblehill.ca/). It will be available at the brewery, their table at the [New Glasgow Farmer's Market](https://ngfarmmarket.com/) tomorrow, and on tap at better beer bars in the province.
