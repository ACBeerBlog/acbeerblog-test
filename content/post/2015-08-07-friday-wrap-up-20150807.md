Happy Friday, thirsty readers! We hope everyone's recovered from [IPA Day](http://www.craftbeer.com/news/ipa-day-returns-thursday-august-6), but fear not, there are lots of new beers and events to keep the good times rolling!

• [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) have a few new beers out now, or on the horizon. Right now at the brewery, they are pouring a cask of _Kiwi IPA_ - an IPA with freshly-squeeze kiwi juice, and dry-hopped with **Citra** and **Comet**. And it was brewed by a Kiwi to boot (their Logistics Manager, Wax, is from New Zealand)! Recent casks have included _Happy Hour_, a keg of their _Beach Chair Lager_ seasoned with local sea salt, tequila and lime and _Peach Chair_, which was their _Beach Chair_ with peach added to the keg. Remember that these casks are one-offs, so it's best to keep up on their [Social](http://www.twitter.com/PEIBrew) [Media](https://www.facebook.com/peibrewingcompany) to avoid disappointment. They have also announced that the next version of the _Vic Park Pale Ale_ will be released very shortly (hopefully next week), and will feature the **Mandarina Bavaria** hop. And good news for fans of the _Vic Park_, the **Citra** version will be canned and available next month to wider distribution. Also coming in September will be the barrel-aged version of their _ReAnimator Bock_. Much like the _Ice Boat_ released last year, the Bock has been aging in the oak barrels for a several months, and will be packaged in 750ml bottles.

• In an update to a story we mentioned a [few months ago](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/05/08/friday-wrap-up-20150508/), the building that [Rogues Roost](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) and [Tom's Little Havana](http://tomslittlehavana.wix.com/cafe) call home, will be coming down this fall. While Tom's had previously found an [alternate location](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/06/05/friday-wrap-up-20150605/), and will be moving in October, it was announced this week that Rogues will be closing mid-September, with the brewery gear going into storage until an alternate location is found. But it's not all bad news, RR fans! Parent company PEI Brewing has announced that _Rogues Roost IPA_ will be produced at the Charlottetown brewery, and will be available for wide distribution next month. Cans of the IPA will be distributed in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. And be sure to drop by Rogues to grab a pint of their _Ruby Porter_, a 5.2% ABV porter, with light bittering to 25 IBUs.

• After making a big splash in Spring, [Tatamagouche Brewing's](http://tatabrew.com/) _Sunrise Trail_ India Session Ale is back. Weighing in at a modest 4.1% ABV, the beer packs a solid hop punch from the **Azacca** and **Ahtanum** varietals, and is perfect for the beautiful weather we've been having. It is available is short supply in **cans** at the brewery, and look for it on tap Stillwell too.

• [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) has released a pair of new beers this week. The first is the return of _Tip of the Spear Spruce Tip IPA_. This 6.2% ABV beer is a returning favourite, brewed with Port Hawkesbury homebrewer Jason Spears. It features Black Spruce tips, and bittered to 75 IBUs. Also hitting the taps in Nyanza and Halifax is their all-**Citra** conspiracy with [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/), named _Gimme Citra Pale Ale_. Weighing in at around 5% ABV, the bitterness on the beer is fairly low but the aroma and flavour are high, as the majority of the hops were added post-boil (during whirlpool, fermentation and conditioning), to preserve the temperature-sensitive oils until they hit your glass. The beer will only be available at the brewery and at Stillwell, both on Barrington and at the [Beergarden](http://www.barstillwell.com/beergarden). And be sure to drop by the brewery today for [Mussels Friday](https://www.facebook.com/events/405581332900064/), starting at 11:30, for mussels simmered in beer, along with local scallions and garlic scapes, with pita chips and black bean dip. Live music will start at 3:30pm.

• [Big Tide Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co/301456876447) and [Hammond River Brewing's](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) collaboration, _Rhubarbic Saison_ is out now. The 7.1% ABV Saison consisted of primarily Pilsner and Wheat malts, and was lightly hopped to 27 IBUs with **Hallertau**. They also added more than 30 kg of fresh rhubard to the boil, primary fermentation, and during conditioning for a big rhubarb aroma and taste. The beer is available on tap (and in growlers) at Big Tide, and will also be available at [The Barrel's Head](http://www.thebarrelshead.com/), [Bourbon Quarter](http://www.bourbonquartersj.com/), [Britt's Pub & Eatery](http://brittspub.ca/), and [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/) soon. And, happy sixth anniversary to Big Tide! Their _Anniversary Amber Ale_, using six types of malts and six varietals of hops, with an ABV of about 6%, will be out very soon.

• [Unfiltered Brewing's](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/) [Pubkegs](http://pubkeg.com/) are now in the wild! Grab a pint of their _Hoppy Fingers APA_, _Exile on North Street IPA_, and _Twelve Years to Zion DIPA_ at [Agricola Street Brasserie](http://agricolastreet.ca/), [PRIMAL Kitchen](http://primalhfx.ca/), Roy's Lounge at [Westin Nova Scotian](http://www.thewestinnovascotian.com/halifax-restaurants), [The Stubborn Goat](http://www.stubborngoat.ca/), and Tom's Little Havana, and is also in the rotation at the [Bishop's Cellar](https://bishopscellar.com/beer/) growler filling station. And keep your eyes open for Unfiltered's first seasonal, coming mid next week.

• Fredericton's [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) is having a busy weekend! Yesterday, in celebration of IPA Day, they had three different versions of their _Yippee IPA_ on at the Brewtique (and there may be a bit of each left to try today). They were each dry-hopped with a pair of different hops: **Cascade** & **Tettnang**, **Saaz** & **Fuggles**, and **Amarillo** & **Rakau**. Out today is _Pride Sally Pride Apricot Ale_. This 4.5% Pale Ale was brewed in collaboration with the [Fredericton Pride](http://klemieux.wix.com/frederictonpride#!events/cjg9) Week. The Pride Week events kick off today with a flag raising at city hall at noon, and a festival (featuring a beer garden) at Officer's Square Sunday at noon, and parade at 1pm.

• Picaroons is also taking advantage of being in Halifax for the [Seaport Beerfest](http://seaportbeerfest.com/), and will be taking over the taps at [Lion & Bright](http://lionandbright.com/) Saturday evening. They will be pouring their _Blonde_, _Dooryard_, _Dark and Stormy Night_, _ESB-231_, _Melonhead_, _Simeon Jones_, and _Yippee IPA_. New brewery [Half Cut Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/HalfCutBrewing) (who brew at their Queen Street Brewtique location) will also be available, pouring their _Alter Ego Altbier_. The taps will switch over at 6pm, and the Pics crew will be coming by after the Beerfest around 10pm to join in the fun, as well as DJ [Jules Bangsworth](https://www.facebook.com/JulesIsOkay), starting at 10pm. There is no cover for the event, pay as you go.

• [Stutz Cider](http://www.stutzcider.com/) has released a new product, _Blueberry Cider_. Using of juice from 7 varietals of NS apples and 100% wild NS blueberries, this special blend comes in at 6.5% ABV. As the juice used was 1/3 blueberry, 2/3 apples, the fresh blueberry flavour shines through nicely, with crisp apple character in the background. It will be available next week at the [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/Pages/advancedSearch.aspx?k=Stutz), in 750 ml bottles.

• [Distillerie Fils du Roy](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/) has released their summer seasonal beer, _La Messe Blanche_. A 7% ABV [Weizenbock](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style15.php#1c), it features strong phenolic (pepper and clove) and banana aromas from the yeast, as well as wheat and yeast character in the flavour. This unfiltered beer features the characteristic cloudiness of this style, thanks to the wheat-derived proteins (also aiding in the thick, fluffy head), and low-flocculating yeast. Bottles are available at the [Petit-Pacquetville](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Distillerie+Fils+du+Roy/@47.6957376,-65.0606416,15z) brewery now, and will be available in select ANBL locations shortly.

• Speaking of the ANBL, in a [press release](http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2015.08.0750.html) out earlier this week, President Brain Harriman confirmed that their Growler Program has been a great success, with over 80,000 litres of beer flowing through the four locations. The program is "here to stay", and they are looking to expand it to a few more locations, dependent on retail space and craft beer sales. All of the local breweries we've spoken with have been very happy with the results and are looking forward to the expanded reach. This week's [list of offerings](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) has not been released, as it is being dubbed a "Wildcard Week", with many different beers available throughout the week at each location. Best to call your local store to find out what's pouring at the time.

• [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) has released their _White Noize_, a 7% ABV Wheat IPA (hoppy American Wheat Ale), hopped to 70 IBUs with **Centennial**, **Cascade**, **Chinook**, and **Columbus**. Drop by for their Quittin' Time Sessions today at 6pm for beer, music from a new, all-female trio named Aster, and food from their friends at Hush Puppies, including a limited number of andouille corn dogs, made with Upstreet beer. And drop by on Sunday for the Weekend Wrap-Up, featuring music concerts on the big screen and community board games in full effect.

• The [Grand Banker](http://www.grandbanker.com/) in Lunenburg has come up with a unique way to serve their beers in-house. They had not been selling pitchers of beer previously, but now have the option to purchase a [1.89l growler or 0.95l grunter](https://www.facebook.com/180399482001129/photos/a.696803580360714.1073741825.180399482001129/950388141668922/?type=1&theater) of beer to drink and share (or not) in the restaurant. These are for **in-house** enjoyment only, though the empty growlers are for sale as souvenirs. Drop by today to grab one, or try a sampler of their expanded craft beer offerings.

• A reminder that the [Seaport Beerfest](http://seaportbeerfest.com/) starts today, with a 7-9:30pm session, and 2-4:30pm & 7-9:30pm sessions tomorrow. While VIP tickets are sold out, there are still general entry [tickets available](http://seaportbeerfest.com/tickets). With several out-of-provinces visiting, look for upcoming collaborations brews to celebrate. Today, the folks from Toronto's [Great Lakes Brewery](http://greatlakesbeer.com/) and Waterford, Ireland's, [Metalman](http://www.metalmanbrewing.com/) brewing dropped by [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) to brew up something special.

In sad local brewery news, Hugh Campbell from [Bar None](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) passed away earlier this week. We had the opportunity to visit with him in his library above the brewery, and he was always quick with a smile and story, and full of life and love for PEI. Our sincere condolences to the Campbell family. We raise a pint in honour of Hugh today.
