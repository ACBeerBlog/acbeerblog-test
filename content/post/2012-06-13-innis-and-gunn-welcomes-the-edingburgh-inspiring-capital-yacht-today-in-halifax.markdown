_Editor's Note:  Here's a press release I received regarding a special event sponsored by Innis & Gunn taking place in Halifax today:_

Toronto: Innis & Gunn, brewers of Canada’s favourite Scottish beer, will welcome the Edinburgh Inspiring Capital on June 13th when it visits Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the Canadian leg of its Clipper 11-12 Round the World Yacht Race. In observance of this internationally recognized program, Innis & Gunn will celebrate the yacht’s arrival from New York by participating in a one-day corporate sail while toasting the crew’s final leg of the race with the brewery’s annual, limited edition Canada Day 2012 beer.

“Through this once-in-a-lifetime experience, Innis & Gunn hopes to further enrich its ties with Canada by sharing Edinburgh culture and hospitality with some of our friends from
Nova Scotia,” said Nicol Rennie, Innis & Gunn international brand manager.

While at sea, the Edinburgh Inspiring Capital crew will aspire to raise funds for its chosen charity, Ocean Youth Trust Scotland. The race is scheduled to finish on July 22nd
in Southampton, UK, after an approximate one-year, round the world race covering 400,000 miles.

“The Clipper Race offers a tremendous opportunity to engage with a worldwide audience,” said Lucy Bird, CEO of Marketing Edinburgh. “We’re delighted to be working with Innis & Gunn, a fantastic example of a Edinburgh-based company with ambitious export targets to grow their market in Canada.”

A post-sail celebration hosted by Innis & Gunn will take place later that evening at The Brooklyn Warehouse (2795 Windsor Street) in Halifax.
