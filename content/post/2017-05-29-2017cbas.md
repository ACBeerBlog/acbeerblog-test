The 15th Annual [Canadian Brewing Awards and Conference](https://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/) was held this weekend in Ottawa, featuring brewing and branding seminars, an exhibition floor with suppliers and manufacturers, and culminating in the Gala event on Saturday night where this year's winners were announced. The results are in, and our local brewers fared quite well in the 60 categories of beer and cider. Congratulations are in order to [Mt. Begbie Brewery](http://www.mt-begbie.com/) in Revelstoke, BC, for taking home **Brewery of the Year** honours, and to [Indie Ale House](http://www.indiealehouse.com/), whose _Spadina Monkey_ Cherry Sour Mash took home **Beer of the Year**.

Also during the Gala, Halifax was announced as the 2018 CBAC host city, and so we will be welcoming the country's best beer and breweries to our region for first time since [Fredericton hosted in 2014](http://acbeerblog.ca/2014/06/03/2014-cbas-wrap-up/).  Emily Tipton, [CBANS](http://nscraftbeer.ca/) President, had this to say, "After just hosting a successful craft beer week showcasing our breweries from all over Nova Scotia, having this national event come to Nova Scotia next year is a testament to the growth of the industry here, and the great support for great craft beer by Nova Scotians.” We'll share all of the dates and registration details when they become available.
