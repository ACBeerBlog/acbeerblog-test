[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/oktoberfest-des-acadiens1.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/oktoberfest-des-acadiens1.jpg)The third annual OktoberFest des Acadiens (Acadien Oktoberfest) will take place August 31st to September 2nd in Northern New Brunswick in the town of Bertrand (located close to Caraquet).  Here's a link to the [official site](http://www.oktoberfestdesacadiens.com/index.htm) although it is completely in French.  Even if you can't read in French it's worth checking out to see some of the pics from the inaugural event.

The event promises a festive and welcoming atmosphere with many in Bavarian costumes with Bavarian music and dance to take place.  There will be outdoor concerts, inflatable toys for kids (let's keep the adults that had a few too many out...) with the chance to sample a variety of beers, cheeses and seafood (you couldn't have an event in this area without seafood!).

I've never attended previous events but have been in nearby Caraquet for multiple "[quinze aout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Acadian_Day)" celebrations and will vouch for the area's love of a good party.  I will post more information as it becomes available.
