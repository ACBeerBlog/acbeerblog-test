Happy April everyone! We made it! Old Man Winter is finally fading away, and the melting has begun in earnest. Before long, it will be time to plant those hop rhizomes...

• Late last week, [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) announced that they were releasing a new beer on tap that day for growler fills and tastings at the brewery. Currently unnamed, it's described as a "Single Abbey"; this type of beer was traditionally brewed by Belgian monks to be lighter and lower alcohol, specifically for consumption at the Abbey during their down-time. Featuring Pilsner and Munich malt from the [Frontenac Malting Co.](http://www.malteriefrontenac.com/index_eng.html) in Quebec, it was lightly hopped with **Bobek** to 23 IBUs, and fermented with the Abbaye yeast from [Fermentis](http://www.fermentis.com/), a strain that is new to Grimross. This light-copper-coloured beer is described by the brewery as having an aroma of banana and bubblegum, with flavours including earthiness, crabapple and lemon zest. It finishes quite dry, and comes in at 5.1% ABV. They've announced that this beer will be the second in their Serendipity series (the first being their _Summer Serendipity_), and they're looking for help naming it! [Tweet](https://twitter.com/GrimrossBrewing/status/583669725949009920) or comment on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=418873628273686&id=110264115801307) your idea with the hashtag, #serendipityseries; if your name is selected, you will win a free growler and fill. The contest ends today at 5 pm.

• [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released their latest One-Hit Wonder this week, _Peated Scotch Ale_. A very robust, full bodied beer at 7.2% ABV, Peated Malt was used to reinforce the flavour and aroma in their traditional _Scotch Ale_ with greater smoke and peat characteristics. **Willamette** and **Warrior** hops were used to balance the body of the beer, and hopped to 19 IBUs. As with all of their One-Hit Wonder releases, these are available for growler fills and samples at the brewery while supplies last (which won't be long!), and in short supply on tap around HRM, so if you spot it, be sure to grab a pint before it's gone! This will surely be a winning beer for fans of Islay-region Scotches (Ardbeg, Laphroaig and Lagavulin, for example), which also use Peated Malt.

• [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) just brewed up a new beer that will be ready in time for [NS Craft Beer Week](http://nscraftbeer.ca/) in May! _Sunrise Trail India Session Ale_ is shaping up to be a highly-sessionable (4.1% ABV), hoppy beer featuring **Ahtanum** and **Azacca** (a very new, hard-to-get, extremely tasty variety). Based on what these hops have to offer, expect this easy-drinking beer to have lots of citrus, tropical, and stone fruit flavours and aromas. TataBrew will also be re-releasing their **Stubborn Goat** collaboration brew, _Horns Over Hooves DIPA_, during the week as well.

• [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) should have a new beer on tap tomorrow at their new location for growler fills. _Orange Rye IPA_ is brewed with several types of malt, including - of course - Rye, coming in with a dark copper color. Hopped entirely with **Cascade** to about 65 IBUs, the beer weighs in at 7.7% ABV. Fresh orange peel was added in secondary to help boost the citrusy flavors and aromas from the hops. Railcar has also confirmed that they've had the final inspection of their new tasting room, so look for them to be able to serve pints of their beer very soon!

• We mentioned [a few weeks ago](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/03/13/friday-wrap-up-20150313/) that the brewers at [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) were experimenting with casks... well, luckily for us, these cask beers will be available to the thirsty public, soon! They plan on having two casks to be tapped at the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) on Friday, April 10th; both their _Whitney Coffee Stout_ and _Primetime APA_ will be featured that night. After that, they hope to have a different cask available at the KSAH on a weekly basis.

• Last week, we reported that [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) had brewed up their final batch of _Breakfast Stout_ for the season. They've since confirmed that a small portion of this batch (approximately 20 L) will be aged for several weeks in a white oak barrel; owner/brewer Shane Steeves will be testing the beer periodically until it develops the character he's looking for, at which point the beer will be kegged and sent to one lucky location! We'll keep you updated on its release.

• [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/) has released a beer of their own creation, _Crush_. Contract-brewed at [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/), this is a 6.1% ABV SMaSH lager, featuring pilsner malt and **Nelson Sauvin** hops. The SMaSH (Single Malt and Single Hop) recipe lets the characteristics of the chosen malt and hop shine through. The pilsner malt (and the fact that it was fermented and conditioned as a lager) is a clean, crisp base upon which to build, and the Nelson Sauvin hops lend a white wine-like flavour, with fruity aromas reminiscent of peach and gooseberry. The lager is unfiltered, and may retain a bit of haze while on tap, allowing more flavour and aroma to come through that would otherwise be filtered out. The beer is available exclusively on tap at the bar (and they've blown through two kegs already!), be sure to check their [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/BarStillwell) for updates of the next keg tapping.

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) is ramping up to release one of their summer seasonals, _Melon Head_, in June... which means they want your cat pictures again! If you think your cat has what it takes to be featured on this year's label, send in an [email](mailto:MelonheadContest@gmail.com) with a hi-resolution picture of him/her (no actual melons needed). You have until Friday, April 24th to have a chance at making your cat famous. And take note that the annual [Prohibition Repeal Party & Tap Takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/1570525696530691/) will be Saturday, April 18th at [Wilser's Room](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wilsers-Room/182990771717169?fref=ts), where all 12 taps will feature Picaroons beer; it starts at 7 pm (no cover if you go before 10:30), and features live music, as usual.

• Tickets for the [Atlantic Beer Festival](http://www.atlanticbeerfestival.ca/) are now on sale. Being held at the [Moncton Coliseum](http://www.monctoncoliseum.com/Page6368.aspx) May 29th-30th, this is the Fest's Tenth anniversary, and they are celebrating by introducing a Friday evening session (7:30-10pm), in addition to the Saturday afternoon (2:30-5pm) and evening (7:30-10pm) sessions. They are also introducing a Belgian Pavillion, highlighting some beers and breweries not otherwise available in New Brunswick, and Fest-goers will be entered in a contest for a free beer-fueled trip to Belgium. We'll have more details on the beers and other Fest events available closer to the date, of course. Tickets are $45 for the Saturday afternoon session, and $55 for the evening sessions (taxes and fees included), and available at the [Moncton Tickets website](https://tickets.moncton.ca/Online/default.asp).

• Like last year, the [Moncton Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/MonctonBeerLeague) will be hosting a VIP experience for the Saturday afternoon session. VIPers will meet at the Pump House Restaurant and Brewery on Orange Lane at noon, and enjoy beer and Tapetizers to prepare for the afternoon. A limousine will take people to the Coliseum, where they will skip the line and begin the session right at 2:30pm. After the session, the limos will return people to the downtown area to visit the Old Triangle or other bars. Part of the VIP ticket price will be going to local charity. Tickets are $70, and there is already a waitlist, but [email them](mailto:mctnbeerleague@gmail.com) to be added, just in case more become available.

• [Horton Ridge Malt](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) have successfully funded their [CEDIF](http://www.novascotia.ca/econ/cedif/), and are now extending the  offering until May 30th. Just shy of $400,000 has been raised toward the Malt House, opening in the fall to process this year's harvest. Congratulations to Horton Ridge, and soon NS and other Atlantic breweries will be using "Malt Less Travelled".

• There are still a handful of tickets available for next Saturday's [Sunset Heights](http://www.sunsetheightsmeadery.com/) Spring Release Party, and they have begun to release details on the expressions to be tasted (and available for purchase), and their food pairings. Here are a few teases: an Elderflower mead paired with strawberry-rhubarb crumble, a Petunia mead paired with brie, and Marigold mead with hot smoked salmon. Attendees will try eight of these pairings, and then have the chance to create their own (or repeat their favourites) from the available offerings. The event is 2:30-5pm April 11 at the Grad House on the UNB campus, and [tickets can be purchased online](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/sunset-heights-meadery-spring-mead-release-party-tickets-16336273233).

Most of our favourite breweries, bars and restaurants are open regular hours this holiday weekend, but be sure to check before heading out, just to be sure. The NSLC, ANBL, PEILCC and NLC are closed Friday and Sunday. [The Townhouse](http://antigonishtownhouse.wordpress.com/) in Antigonish is closed for a short break while owners Rose and Terry do some R&D in England. You can follow along with their adventures on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AntigonishTownhouse). The Townhouse will be re-opening Tuesday April 14th. The Picaroons Brewtique is hoping your Saturday is Hoppy, and they are helping with four dry-hopped variants on tap tomorrow for your tasting pleasure: _Man's Best Friend_ dry-hopped with **Tettnang**, _Yippee IPA_ dry-hopped with **Amarillo**, their _Blonde_ dry-hopped with **Cascade**, and _Irish Red_ dry-hopped with **Goldings**.
