Hello, beer fans! Another Friday = another helping of beer news from Atlantic Canada. Let's get started with more hop harvest beers, picking up from last week...

• We have more details on the recently-brewed _Harvest Ale_ from [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery). The beer was wet-hopped (i.e. the hops used are used just after harvesting, instead of being dried in an [oast house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oast_house), or "fresh") with **Cascade** hops grown on owner/brewer Shane Steeves' property. With a grist consisting of 2-row, Carapils, and Crystal 40 L malt, the beer is expected to come in at 6.8% ABV, with about 70 IBUs. Look for it on tap at bars/restaurants in the Saint John area sometime in the next 2-3 weeks.

• The brewers at [Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) have a new beer on the go; they've managed to get their hands on some fresh **Cascade** and **Chinook** hops from a local farm in the Grand Falls area (owned by Yan and France Desjardins), which they will incorporate into a "Harvest" _Bob LeBoeuf_. The beer will be hopped more-heavily than normal, with more hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness (30-40 IBUs vs. the usual 22 for the beer). This new beer should be available for growler fills at the brewery, and at local bars/restaurants, by around September 25th.

• Speaking of Petit-Sault, their two flagship beers (_Tante Blanche_ and _Bob LeBoeuf_) continue to move across the province - they're now available at ANBL stores in Dalhousie, Saint-Quentin, Campbellton, Moncton, Dieppe, and Kennebecasis Valley. Check the [ANBL Product Page](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Products?OrderAscending=true&Take=25&Skip=0&Search=Petit-Sault) for a location near you! Petit-Sault has also announced that in addition to the 1.89 L Growlers available for fills at the brewery, they are now offering 950 mL "Grunters" for fill ($6.50 for a one-time purchase of the Grunter, plus $5.50 and $5.75 for fills of _Bob_ and _Tante_, respectively).

• [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has teamed up with Ontario's [Beau's All Natural Brewing](http://www.beaus.ca/) for a collaboration brew: _Sweet Rye'd Harvest Wheat Ale_. Brewed with Munich, Wheat, Rye, and Pale Malt, this copper-coloured beer weighs in at 6.0% ABV, and 40 IBUs, thanks to **Citra**, **Cascade**, and **Columbus** hops. However, Beau's brought a special ingredient to the collaboration: [bog myrtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrica_gale) (Beau's uses this in a [couple](http://www.beaus.ca/beer/seasonal/bog_water) of [beers](http://www.beaus.ca/beer/wild_oats/bog_father) in their lineup). Thanks to this plant, which is a very common ingredient in the bittering of [gruits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruit), a more herbaceous and spiced character comes through. Catch this Sweet Rye'd at the brewery, private stores, and NSLC very soon.

• Garrison is also brewing up a couple more Harvest-themed beers in the next little while: their popular _3 Fields Harvest Wet-Hopped Ale_ will be brewed this weekend. Hop picking will take place Saturday, and the beer will be brewed Sunday. Hops will be coming in from [Ross Farm Museum](https://rossfarm.novascotia.ca/), [Meander River Farm and Brewery](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/), and [Fiddle Hop Farms](http://www.fiddlehop.ca/). If you would like to take part in the fun, volunteers are needed at Meander River in Ashdale to help with the hop picking, starting at 9am. Or, you can help de-bine the hops right at the brewery, from 2-5pm. Come on out for good times and refreshments!

• We don't have many details on their other harvest beer, but we do know that it features some gourds from the [Howard Dill Farm](http://www.howarddill.com/dill-farm.html)! Also, for our [homebrewing](http://brewnosers.org/forums/) readers, they have announced the style for the 2015 Home Brew-Off Challenge, [12B Robust Porter](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style12.php#1b). With the competition judging not taking place until Spring, that gives you plenty of time to do some test batches.

• More Harvest beer news! Not to be outdone, [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) is once again releasing their _Harvest Ale_ next Monday, September 15th. This year's release will feature **seven** different beers, all hopped with a variety harvested from various local farms. There will be three different **Cascade** beers, one each of **Centennial**, **Galena**, and **Goldings**, and one "Kitchen Sink" beer that will have a little bit of everything! Check out the special [Harvest Ale webpage](http://www.picaroons.ca/myharvest/), and click on the link matching the code on your bottle to find out more about where the hops for that were harvested. Look for it to pop up at bars/restaurants in the area, as well.

• [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/) is taking a slightly-different approach to Harvest beers - they've gathered hops from several local sources (including some grown on their own property) to brew up a series of "Harvest Fruit Beers". Two of these beers will be _Strawberry Delight_, brewed with local strawberries and two different hop varieties grown on [Nature's Estate Farm](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Natures-Estate-Farm/206856049392577), and _Wild Blueberry Wheat_, brewed with local wild blueberries and another undetermined hop variety. Look for these (and their other Harvest beers) to be released in the near future.

• Finally in Harvest beer news (for this week, at least!), [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) and [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) have brewed up their second annual _Many Hands Pale Ale_ conspiracy. However, this beer is a twist on the traditional Pale Ale, with one hundred pounds of locally-grown buttercup squash added to the mash. Two-row and amber malts make up the grain bill, while the hops are a combination of over ten pounds of **Chinook** from Boxing Rock's own fields (in the mash), with **Cascade** (first-wort), **Mount Hood**, and **Centennial** from [LaHave Natural Farms](http://lahavenaturalfarms.com/). The beer weighs in at 6.5% ABV and 37 IBUs, and will debut later this month.

• [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) is adding a new beer to their core line up, _Organic Ale_. This Blonde Ale weighs in at 4.5% and 20 IBUs and is brewed with Certified Organic Pale and Pilsner malt, and Certified Organic **Centennial** hops. The light-bodied and refreshing beer features a clean finish, and a hint of citrus hop character. The Organic certification comes by way of [Atlantic Certified Organic](http://www.atlanticcertifiedorganic.ca/), a nationally-recognized certification cooperative. The Organic Ale is available starting today at both the Halifax and Dartmouth brewery locations in bottles and growlers, and will be in six-packs at the NSLC shortly.

• After recent voting by the public on two different Coffee Stouts released by [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/), they've decided on a winner! _Transmitter Stout_ is their _Sydney Street Stout_ blended with 10% locally roasted and brewed coffee from [Receiver Coffee Co.](https://www.facebook.com/receivercoffeeco) in Charlottetown. The 5.6% ABV beer made its debut at last weekend's [PEI Beer Fest](http://peibeerfest2014.com/), and is currently available on tap at the brewery, and in limited-release, wax-dipped 750 mL bottles at the brewery now, and shortly at the [PEILCC](http://www.peilcc.ca/). And bumping up their _Sydney Street Stout_ even further, they have [filled two Jack Daniels barrels](https://www.facebook.com/peibrewingcompany/photos/a.654975061182609.1073741824.370251152988336/920928324587280/?type=1&theater) with the beer, for a special release around Christmas.

• The 2nd annual [Fredericton Poutine Festival](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonPoutineFestival) is fast approaching! Held on Saturday, November 8th, it will once again take place at the [Delta Fredericton](https://www.deltahotels.com/Hotels/Delta-Fredericton). Featuring all-you-can-eat poutine from several restaurants, there will also be at least 15 different beers from local breweries, tentatively including Big Axe, [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307), Hammond River, Petit-Sault, Pump House, [Railcar](http://railcarbrewing.com/), Red Rover, and [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/), as well as [Unibroue](http://www.unibroue.com/), [Le Naufrageur](http://www.lenaufrageur.com/), and [McClelland Premium Imports](http://www.mcclellandbeers.ca/). Tickets will go on sale this Tuesday, September 16th at 2:00 pm; you'll be able to purchase them online when the [official website](http://frederictonpoutinefestival.weebly.com/) goes live that day. We'll have a standalone post with more info on the festival that day; in the meantime, check out our write-up on last year's festival [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/fredericton-poutine-fest-wrap-up-and-early-details-on-2014-fredericton-craft-beer-fest/).

• [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) has some big news for cider fans in Saint John this week - starting this Sunday, Sept. 14th, they will be present at the weekly (until mid-October) [Queen Square Farmers Market](https://www.facebook.com/QueenSquareFarmersMarket) for 1 L flagon exchanges. From 9:00 am - 2:00 pm, you will be able to exchange empty flagons for full ones ($12), or purchase prefilled flagons for $18.50; the first offerings will be _Spring Brew_ and _Summer Brew_. And if you'd like to try some Red Rover cider on tap, they're now available at the [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/)!

• There's a new blended beer pouring at the [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/) brewpub in Moncton; _Black & Blue_ is a combination of their _Blueberry Ale_ and _Muddy River Stout_. It's on for a limited time, and only at this location, so stop on by for a pint before it's gone.

• [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) has released _Tim's Dirty IPA_ this week. Brewed with **Chinook**, **Nugget** and **Simcoe** hops, this beer weighs in at 84 IBU and 6.8% ABV, and we here reports that it's even better than last time! It is available at the brewery for growler and Yapper fills, and will be on tap at your favourite establishments province-wide. This beer was first brewed in January, as the winner of Inaugural Home Brew Competition, to coincide with the [Local Connections](http://localconnections.ca/) Craft Beer and Food Celebration. Good news, as both the Competition and Celebration are returning! The Celebration is taking place January 15th, 2015 and early-bird tickets are [now on sale](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/482/craft-beer-and-local-food-celebration-2015). The competition will be taking place at the beginning of December, and we will be sharing details on how to enter when available.

• If you live in Newfoundland and have been enjoying the recent [YellowBelly](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) cider, _Yellow Mellow_, on tap at the brewpub, good news! It is now available in bottles - 1 L fliptops - at the brewery only. Stop by and pick some up, so you can enjoy some cider goodness in the comfort of your own home.

• [Big Axe Brewery](http://www.bigaxe.ca/) is now offering 950 mL Grunters (in addition to Growlers) for fills at the brewery in Nackawic. Prices are $5.50 for the purchase of an empty Grunter, and $7.50 for fills. Grab a _Chanterelle Cream Ale_,_ Shakesbeer Chocolate Oatmeal Stout_ or the _Simon Saaz Summer Ale_ before it's done for the season. Look out for their next seasonal, coming soon!

• [Meander River Farm and Brewery](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/) held their first Shareholder-only cask tapping at the brewery this week. Their _Wheat Beer_ had been dry-hopped with Glacier hops, and the cask infused with peaches and ginger, and primed with local honey. For those who don't want to miss out on the fun next time, be sure to check out their [Community Supported Brewery Program](http://www.meanderriverfarm.ca/the-brewery/). They are looking for volunteers to help with the hop harvest **tomorrow**, beginning at 9, so why not drop by for some fun. Refreshments will be provided!

• [Celtic Oktoberfest](http://celticoktoberfest.ca/) is being held, Saturday, 25 October 2014 from 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM, at the Port Hawkesbury Civic Centre. Featuring beer from ten NS craft breweries, and food from some of the best Cape Breton and NS restaurants, this all-inclusive evening will be a great time. A Kitchen Party is nothing without music, so there will be several bands playing that evening as well. We cannot give away too many details just yet, but we are able to announce that a [Pumpkin Launch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_chunking) competition will be held that weekend, and is open to groups wishing to take part. We'll have more information on the Oktoberfest, and surrounding events, next week.

• And in a further update on the progress of the ANBL Growler Program, they now have a [webpage](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) where you can check to see what is currently pouring at the three pilot stores. Keep in mind that days and hours when you can get your growler filled are limited to Thursdays and Fridays from 4:00 pm - 8:30 pm, and Saturdays from noon - 8:30 pm, though these may change due to customer demand.
