[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/beerfest-logo1.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/beerfest-logo1.jpg)It has been said that Disneyland is the [happiest place on earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingdom).  Anyone who believes that has never been to a beer festival.

The 2012 Atlantic Canada Beer Festival circuit will kickoff in with [Beer Fest St. John's](http://www.nlliquor.com/events/ConsumerSampling.asp).  Details are few at this point (three to be exact). The festival will take place Thursday, March 22nd and Friday, March 23rd at the St. John's Convention Center with tickets going on sale Friday, March 2nd.

I'll pass on more information as it is available.
