You might think that the last week of February/first week of March would see a bit of a slowdown in beer news — winter’s not quite over, March break is yet to come and the University students are back in class. But if you write a beer blog and you try to keep up with it all, you know better. There are plenty of things to tell you about as the region prepares for one of its biggest annual events, the [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/). As well, seasonal beers are being released, plenty of events going on, another new brewery has opened its doors and we’ve received word of another brewery in the works! We’re starting to think there might possibly be something to this whole “Craft Beer Industry” thing.

• The wait is over for local beer fans in Lawrencetown, in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley! [Lunn's Mill Beer](https://lunnsmill.beer/) held their first growler session yesterday afternoon, with their four core beers available (_Charming Molly_ Blonde Ale, _Brickyard Red_ Red Ale, _Lunn's Pub Ale_ English Ale, and _XPA #1_ IPA). For those [who contact them ASAP](mailto:preorder@lunnsmill.beer?subject=Growler Delivery Service), there will be the first Growler Delivery happening **this afternoon**, for folks in the Annapolis Royal to Greenwood region. For now, Growler Nights and Delivery will be the best way to get your hands on Lunn's Mill beer, and we will be sure to let you know when the brewery is set up for samples and pints, as well as draft available at local pubs and restaurants. Congratulations to Mark, Sean, and the whole Lunn's Mill Crew!

• We've received word of another new brewery on the way for New Brunswick, with [Valonray Farmhouse Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/Valonraybrewing/) (changed from the initial name, "46th Parallel Brewing") scheduled to open later this summer in [MacDougall Settlement](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/MacDougall+Settlement,+NB/@46.2831206,-64.9030351,10z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4ca0ecca62e41247:0x15c795db30128d82!8m2!3d46.2689049!4d-64.701687). Founded by Phil and Allison Fontaine, they plan on launching with a small line-up of American-style ales - brewed by Phil on a 1 BBL (115 L) electric system - with Belgian-style barrel-aged ales following within a few months, thanks to the acquisition of twenty 225 L oak barrels. The initial beers will be available at select licensees, as well as some being bottled and sold through the ANBL. The couple will be using 100%-locally sourced ingredients, with some being grown directly on-site. A tap room is also in the planning stages, and will hopefully be open by the summer of 2018. The eventual goal is to become an authentic Belgian-style, Farmhouse brewery within the first few years, including expanding to barrel-aged sour beers. Look for a Q&A with Allison and Phil from us in the near future.

• Early this week, [Maybee Brewing](http://www.maybeebrew.com/) released _Mars Madness_, a Bière de Mars. This style is closely related to the Bière de Garde, a French style traditionally brewed in the early spring, and then cellared for several months to be enjoyed during warmer weather. Bière de Mars, on the other hand, is usually brewed in March and released immediately. It is in some ways similar to a Belgian Saison, especially in that the yeast provides a lot of the character, with a malty backbone from the grist. _Mars Madness_ was fermented at a low temperature to keep the fruity esters in check, and had a lengthier conditioning time than usual for Maybee brews. Described by the brewery as a crisp, refreshing beer, it has "fruity notes of banana and bubble gum, and subtle hints of noble hop spice and clove". Clocking in at 6.7% ABV and 30 IBUs, this one is available on tap only. For those of you attending the [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) next week, it will be available on cask at both the afternoon and evening sessions.

• Dartmouth's [Downeast Beer Factory](http://downeastbeerfactory.com/) has a new beer on tap, perfect for the approaching St. Patrick's Day holiday. _Nitro Irish Stout_ was brewed with plenty of Roasted Barley and Midnight Wheat in the grist, to give lots of the roasted aromas and flavours expected from the style. Both **Cascade** and **East Kent Goldings** hops were added, with "a generous amount" of EKG at the end of the boil. Served on a 75/25 nitrogen/CO2 blend to boost the creamy mouthfeel, it's easy-drinking at 4.8% ABV, and on tap right now at the brewpub.

• With the [2017 Brier](http://www.curling.ca/2017brier/) kicking off this week in St John's, [YellowBelly Brewpub](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) has released a new beer to celebrate. They've released the quintessential American Pale Ale, weighing in at 4.5% ABV and 40 IBU, featuring two dry-hopping rounds with **Cascade**. The beer is on tap now (and only on tap, no plans for bottles), but they need your help to name it! Hit them up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Yellowbellybrew) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yellowbellybrew/photos/rpp.254136378026376/1088166997956639/?type=3&theater) with your best curling pun name to win a $100 gift certificate. And once this small batch APA kicks, their St Patrick's Day celebration _Patrick's Pale Ale_ will hit the taps. This year's version features **Sorachi Ace** as the sole hop in the 6.0% ABV, 45 IBU beer.

• After two straight releases of the decidedly less hoppy variety, [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/) is bringing out a beer today to remind everyone just who punches the hoppy dance cards in HRM. And speaking of dancing, the beer is being released in conjunction with the film [Goon: Last of the Enforcers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goon:_Last_of_the_Enforcers), which will be screened in Halifax on March 9 a week ahead of its March 17 release date. _Fist of God_ is a NASHian DIPA in the Northeast IPA style with 100+ IBU and featuring a mix of **Citra**, **Simcoe**, **Columbus** and **Mosaic** hops for big citrus, tropical and dank aromas and flavors. At 8% ABV, it’s also likely to leave you in a bit of a FoG if you’re not careful. Look for it at the brewery and Charm School pub for pints and fills as of noon today, as well as on tap at Primal Kitchen, Stillwell (from Friday open), and Tom’s Little Havana (who will keep it on tap as long as Unfiltered can supply it).

• And while you are grabbing a pint and/or growler at Unfiltered today, be sure to try the other latest addition to their taps, [kombucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) from [Mad Boocha](https://www.facebook.com/madboocha/). Brewed in small batches in the Unfiltered brewhouse, kombucha is produced using yeast and bacteria, fermenting sweet tea into a lightly acidic and refreshing low-, or no-, alcohol drink. Mad Boocha has released several styles of the drink, with a _Hibiscus Ginger_ version available currently for both pints and take-away in growlers at Unfiltered. Keep an eye on their [social](https://www.facebook.com/madboocha/) [media](https://www.instagram.com/mad_boocha/) [pages](https://twitter.com/Mad_Boocha) for more details on the next releases.

• [North](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) is releasing a new beer today, a Belgian Dubbel named _Doki Doki Dubbel_. Not your typical Dubbel, this one had a secondary fermentation on black cherries, gives notes of cherry, raisin, and dark fruit in the flavour, along with a light spiciness in the finish. Weighing in at 7.4% ABV, it will be available for growler fills, as well as in 750 mL swing tops. [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) will have it on tap, and it will be available at tonight's [North Tap Takeover at Good Robot](https://www.facebook.com/events/264583003978099/); it may also appear at other beer establishments in the HRM in the near future.

• Earlier this week [Boxing Rock](http://boxingrock.ca/) in Shelburne brought a new beer to market in a style not common around these parts, and certainly not one we’ve seen from a local brewery any time recently. _Stayin’ Alive_ is a malty lager in the traditional bock style, fairly high in alcohol and hopped very mildly for a satisfying and filling experience. Originating in the town of Einbeck some 700 years ago, it was commonly brewed and consumed by monks as a means of maintaining nutrition during pre-Easter fasting. Though they eschewed the _de rigueur_ billy goat on the label, Boxing Rock’s version stays true to the style, coming in at 6.8% ABV, with biscuit, bread and roast flavours, smooth bittering and just a touch of noble hop flavor. You can find it now at the brewery, at private stores in HRM, and on tap at [tap accounts](http://boxingrock.ca/where-buy) throughout Nova Scotia. And speaking of taps, Boxing Rock has announced their Legendary Keg Club contest, where the winner will see a beer tap installed in his or her home and Boxing Rock will supply 6 months of beer to stock it! To enter, simply go to the [contest page](http://thechronicleherald.ca/contests/legendary-keg-club) and fill in the blanks appropriately.

• Like Boxing Rock, [Saltbox Brewing](http://www.saltboxbrewingcompany.ca/) in Mahone Bay will also be hopping on the seasonal malty German lager train early in March, but with the bigger, beefier version of the bock style, the Doppelbock. Doppel being German for “double”, doppelbock takes the maltiness of the bock to deeper, darker places where more roasty and dark fruit flavours emerge. _Doppelbock 1753_ pays tribute to the German heritage of the South Shore and is subtitled, “The Winter Beer of Lunenburg County.” This beer features the requisite malty sweetness as well as rich plum flavours, hints of dark chocolate and a slightly warming mouthfeel consistent with the 8.1% ABV. A characteristically low 19 IBU provide slight bitterness to this dark brown brew that finishes with a lingering vinous character.​ A firm launch date has not yet been determined, but watch the brewery's [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/saltboxbrewery) where it will surely be announced. _Late notice addition: Launch Date is March 10th._

• After celebrating their First Anniversary this week, the fine folks at [Nine Locks Brewing](http://www.ninelocksbrewing.ca) have decided to give us all the gift of another new beer! Launching this coming Monday, _Vanilla Porter_ will be available on draft and in cans. Featuring three separate additions of vanilla, this full-bodied porter blends dark chocolate and vanilla together in a great brew. At 5.0% ABV and a light 25 IBU, the malt and vanilla are the stars of the show. Keep an eye on their [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/ninelocksbrew) for the exact launch details.

• Launching at next weekend's Fredericton Craft Beer Festival is a cross-Confederation-Bridge Collaboration, between Charlottetown's [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) and Fredericton's [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) breweries. Brewed using the same malt bill, featuring a healthy dose of Rye malt, _Rye'd On_ is an 8.0% ABV Imperial Rye Beer, but fermented with two different yeasts. Upstreet's Hogie brewed the beer at his brewery in Charlottetown, and then travelled to Fredericton to assist in brewing the same beer on the Picaroons system. In Fredericton, the beer was fermented using Pics' own Ringwood ale strain, while in C'town, Upstreet used a pitch of lager yeast normally destined for their _Commons_ Pilsner. The result is two different beers with a common origin. You'll have the first chance to try the beer at the Fest March 11th, and to a wider release at both [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) and [PEILCC](http://liquorpei.com/) stores, and on draft in both provinces on Monday the 13th.

• [Hammond River](http://hrbrewing.ca/) is brewing a new American IPA next week - single-hopped with **Summit**, this is a high alpha-acid American variety known for providing plenty of orange, tangerine, and citrus character in beer. Going in the dry-hop with the Summit will be lots of freshly-zest grapefruit zest, so we can likely expect a beer chock-full of citrus character! Expect this one to come in at around 6.5% ABV and 60 IBUs, and to start popping up on tap in a few weeks.

**And the goings-on keep going strong:**

• Head out to Digby's [Roof Hound](https://www.facebook.com/roofhound/) this Saturday, **March 4th**, for another Beer Launch Music Event. Kicking off their "Dive Bar Classic Cocktail Series", they are releasing the _Mojito Dry Hopped Sour_ that we told you about last week. Weighing in at 4.8% ABV, the light-bodied tart beer features loads of freshly zested and squeezed limes and fresh mint. To celebrate, they are holding a live music event that evening, with Hannah-Grace playing from 10pm, after the beer starts flowing at 9pm.

• For those of you in Halifax, drop by [Lion & Bright](http://lionandbright.com/) **Saturday** night from 8pm for a [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) takeover of their taps. Featuring their core lineup, as well as a few seasonal and fun favourites, there will sure to be something for everybody flowing tomorrow night. Find out more on their [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/182777105552832/).

• [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) continues to keep their schedule packed with goings-on. After last night’s tap takeover at Battery Park in Dartmouth, tonight sees North-end neighbours North Brewing [populating 8 of the GR taps](https://www.facebook.com/events/264583003978099/) completing a craft beer _quid pro quo_ celebrating the collaboration beer _Moo Nay Tripel_ that we told you about last week. On **Wednesday**, they bring you [FemmeBot](https://www.facebook.com/events/175227282976848/), a celebration of International Women’s Day hosted by comedian Megan McDowell. They’ll have three new beers on tap: _Red Moon Landing_, a Red IPA that celebrates the African American women who were key to NASA space missions (and who inspired the film Hidden Figures); _Baba Yaga Chaga Brown_, an American Brown Ale featuring **Chaga Fungus** that invokes a supernatural feminine spirit of Slavic folklore; and, _Faster Pussy Hat! Kill! Kill!_ a hibiscus-infused IPA. The first two of these were brewed by female staff of Good Robot, the third by Glee Club member and home brewer, Robyn Vaughan. There will also be guest taps from other breweries with prominent female brewers, including Sober Island, Boxing Rock, Spindrift and Lazy Bear. Much more information is available on the event’s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=femmebot%3A%20taproom%20takeover) and Thursday’s article in [The Coast](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/femme-bot-celebrates-women-with-woman-made-beer/Content?oid=6319641&utm_content=buffer681e1&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).

• Next week is Fredericton Craft Beer Week, with plenty of events leading up to the grand finale, the FCBF, on **March 11th**. In addition to these events, the [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/theJamesJoycePubFredericton/) will be hosting a [New Brunswick IPA Showdown](https://www.facebook.com/events/430835767256742/) from **Tuesday, March 7th to Thursday, March 9th**. During this time period, all 25 taps (and a cask) will be pouring various IPA styles, ranging from American to English, White to Black, and beyond! All of your favourites will be on, as well as some new beers, including the first appearance of Saint John's [Loyalist City Brewing](https://loyalistcitybrewing.ca), which will have both their _Hop Series Cascade_ and _Hop Series Motueka_ on tap at some point. Be sure to show up and order some flights (and/or full pours) to get your hop fix!

• Also next Thursday, **March 9th**, don't forget to stop by the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) for their [Nova Scotia Tap Takeover and Trivia Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/1810907255861607/). Lots of great NS beer, lots of easier (we promise) trivia questions from Shawn and Chris... and lots of brewery swag to the winners! Beer starts pouring at 6 pm, with trivia following at 7 pm. No charge to attend, but if you [buy a ticket in advance](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/nova-scotia-tap-take-over-fcbf17-tickets-30324944726?aff=FB) you get a special glass and ten 5 oz pours to get you started. And once you're done there, maybe you can head down the street to [Graystone](http://graystonebrewing.com/) to sample some beers from their [New Brunswick NanoTakeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/403382463344232/), where 8 different small NB breweries will have their beers on tap.

Enjoy your weekend, and as always, just a few more things before signing off...
