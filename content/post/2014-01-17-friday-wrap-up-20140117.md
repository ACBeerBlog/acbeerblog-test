Happy Friday everyone! Here's what's going on in our region these days:

• Back in October [we posted](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/21/hammond-river-brewing-to-open-this-fall-in-new-brunswick/) about a new brewery, [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery), opening in Quispamsis, NB later in the fall. The official launch of the brewery was unfortunately delayed; however, owner/brewer Shane Steeves has indicated that his first beers should be available sometime in February. We'll keep you updated when we know exactly when Hammond River's first beers will be pouring at the official launch at the [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/)!

• Speaking of Saint John, [Big Tide Brewing](http://bigtidebrew.com/) has a couple of new beers; brewer Wendy Papadopoulos has given us some info on both. Currently on tap is the _Crasberry Cream Ale_, a still-hanging-on-to-the-holidays Cream Ale brewed with cranberry juice and raspberry extract; it clocks in at 5% ABV. They should also be releasing a Winter Warmer this weekend - this currently unnamed beer is brewed with smoked malt and Caramunich, with some bourbon added for extra flavor, and comes in at 7% ABV.

• Halifax's [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) is releasing a new beer today, a collaboration with [Java Blend Coffee Roasters](https://www.facebook.com/JavaBlend). It is a Belgian Coffee Brown Ale, made with 2 kg of Guatemalan [El Injerto Pandora del Carmen](http://javablendcoffee.myshopify.com/products/guatemala-el-injerto-pandora-del-carmen-pacamara) beans. The folks at Java Blend did a special roast of the beans, and a 24-hour cold brew, before being added to the beer. Look for it at the brewery and [Alderney Market](http://www.alderneylanding.com/market/) this weekend.

• [Hell Bay Brewing](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/), from Liverpool, NS, has released a new beer, the _R.I.P.(A) IPA_. Over the next few months, they will be releasing several IPAs, and asking for feedback on the beers. At the end of the series, they'll be having a taste-off to determine the winning style. The first version weighs in at 7.2%, is pale and finishes dry, and is moderately hopped (for an IPA). Look for the beer at the brewery, only available in growlers. The next version will feature even more hops, so watch out for that!

• In other Hell Bay news, consumers in more locations around the province will soon be able to purchase their English Ale at the [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/). We don't have all of the details yet (which stores will be participating), but will be sure to pass them along when available. It should be on shelves before the end of the month.

• And finally, Hell Bay has been nominated for a [Lunenburg-Queens Business Excellence Award](http://www.lqbusinessawards.ca/nominees/2013). They are up for the 2013 Small Business Award. The winning announcement will take place February 17th. Best of luck!

• Have you purchased your tickets for the [2014 Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) on March 8th? Well, they're currently having a contest on their[ Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonCraftBeerFestival); like and share the link indicated, and you'll have a chance to win two tickets to the festival AND the 2014 [Fredericton Poutine Festival](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonPoutineFestival)... that's a $190 value! The winner will be drawn today at approximately 4:00 pm. Just a reminder... last year's event sold out weeks before it was held. With about 70% of this year's tickets already gone, and the event promising to be even better than last year, don't hesitate much longer! And there are still rooms available at the Crowne Plaza just across the street, at the special Beer Fest rate. Check them out [here](https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&eventID=10870992&utm_source=55344&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=26787945).

• [The PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) sent an interesting cask to [Bar Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) yesterday; the "Dry-Hopped, Barrel-Aged, Farmhouse Saison"! This very tart beer (the wort - what beer is before yeast does its thing - was originally destined to be_ Sir John A's Honey Wheat_) was initially fermented with a Saison yeast and aged in an oak red wine barrel since last summer. After it finally made its way into the cask, fresh yeast was added, and the beer was dry-hopped with [Santiam](http://beerlegends.com/santiam-hops), a European-type aroma hop that has spicy, herbal and floral qualities. With an ABV of ~5%, this sounds like a very interesting beer!

• Speaking of Stillwell Beer Bar, they are holding the [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) X [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) Tap Takeover tomorrow. Tickets are sold out, however they will be tweeting during the event if seats become available. You might not be able to score one of the [slick glasses](http://instagram.com/p/jPbBm7KAGv/) created especially for the event, but you will be able to try some of the great beers being poured. Look for Boxing Rock's U-889 RIS with vanilla beans and Crafty Jack Brown Ale, as well as Big Spruce's Tim's Dirty IPA and Cereal Killer Sideways (Oatmeal Stout infused with Bowmore).

• A reminder that the "Name The Beer!" competition, [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons)' new beer to honour [The Lunar Rogue Pub](https://www.facebook.com/thelunarroguepub)'s 25th anniversary, closes today. Post up your favourite name on their Facebook page, and you might just win a tasty prize package, a Draught and Dinner party for you and five of your worthy friends.

• We've got a reminder, and some great news for homebrewers who are thinking of entering the [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) Home Brew-Off competition this year. [Noble Grape](http://noblegrape.ca/for-the-passionate-winemaker/feature/) will be doing an all-grain brewing demo of a Weizen at Garrison Brewery tomorrow from 10-2pm. This is a great opportunity to ask questions and watch the techniques used by more advanced home brewers (and you'll see it isn't so tough to do after all!). The great news is that all of the beers entered into the competition will be tasted and judged by BJCP-certified judges. The judging has always been impartial and blind (the identity of the beer or brewer were never revealed to the judges), but having the BJCP judges whittle down **all** entries to the finale means that the notes and scoresheets back from the competition should offer some insight not otherwise available. If you were on the fence as to whether to enter or not, hopefully this steers you towards YES!


That's it for this week... have a great weekend!
