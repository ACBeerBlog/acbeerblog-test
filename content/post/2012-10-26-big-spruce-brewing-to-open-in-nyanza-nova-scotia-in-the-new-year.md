[As reported by the Canadian Beer News](http://www.canadianbeernews.com/2012/10/26/big-spruce-brewing-opening-next-year-in-cape-breton/), a new brewery is being planned for Nyanza, Cape Breton.  The new operation is described on [its Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing?ref=ts&fref=ts) as "an organic hop farm and brewery start up".  The new brewery's beer is expected to be available in January 2013 in 50 L and 20 L kegs and growlers.

Additional information on the new brewery (which was originally scheduled to be called The Kilted Moose) can be found in this [CBC article](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2012/08/24/ns-cape-breton-brew-pub.html) and this post from [Dream Big Cape Breton](http://dreambigcapebreton.com/2012/09/03/local-beer-update-big-spruce-brewing/).
