Another full week of Atlantic Canadian Beer News, and we'll focus on the[ Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) Home Brew-Off, whose results were announced last night at a great gala.

Last year's Brew-Off winner, Kellye Robertson, was in attendance to help launch "Kellye R's Wild Rye'd IPA". The beer was on tap, and the double-dose of Citra she and Brewmaster Daniel Girard used really comes through, and it's great! I can see this beer selling out quickly, so be sure to pick it up soon, where better beer is sold. Brian Titus also announced that after she finishes her diploma at the Niagara College in the [Brewmaster and Brewery Operations Management](http://www.niagaracollege.ca/content/Programs/WineryViticultureStudiesCFWI/BrewmasterandBreweryOperationsManagement.aspx) program, she will be returning to work at Garrison. Welcome aboard!

Daniel spoke about the challenges of scoring and picking winners from 69 entries. They had to change their plan this year to taste and evaluate the beer in groups of 8, with several folks helping to whittle it down to a final four. The final four were judged the day of the gala, by three BJCP-certified judges, and from them, the winner was chosen. And the winner is... Peter Welton!

The judges loved the carbonation level and clarity of his beer, and thought it was a great example of the Belgian Blonde style. Peter will be brewing his beer with Daniel in the spring. Congratulations, Peter! Also congratulations to Andrew, Gerald and Dewi for top four finishes. We were fortunate to try all of the beer, and they were all great. Well done!

I was also lucky enough to snap a picture of the 3 previous Brew-Off Winners in front of the trophy now on display at Garrison (only 4 years late). Brian Harvey (2009, Harvey's Bitter), Adam Comeau (2011, Adam Und Eric's Neuschottland Schwarz Black Lager), Scott Tilford (2010, Nit-Wit Belgian Wit).

In other important news, next year's Home Brew-Off style was announced (after much poking and torturing of Mr. Titus), and it is[ BJCP Style 15A: Weizen/Weissbier](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style15.php#1a). So start your kettles now, homebrewers! This is one of my favourite styles of beer, so I'm looking forward to brewing up a few test batches to perfect a recipe for submission.

In other Garrison news, their next One Hop beer will be released soon, and it will be showcasing the Citra hop. I've got word that there might be more than one batch of this made, which means we won't run into a sold-out situation like we did with the Comet release. As I mentioned above, I'm a big fan of Citra, so I can't wait!
