Happy IPA Day, everyone! This now-annual "national beer holiday" celebrates what is arguably North America's favorite beer style (by craft beer lovers, anyway). It was founded in 2011, and over a short time has already become a much-anticipated day of summer. Breweries and beer bars all over the world hold events and release special beers to celebrate the India Pale Ale, whether it be American, English, Imperial, Black, White, Red... and so on. Ashley Routson (@TheBeerWench on Twitter), one of the founders of IPA Day, explains what you can do to share your IPA love:

"On August 1, share your photos, videos, blog posts, tasting notes, recipes and thoughts on IPA with the world. Be sure to tag your posts on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Google+ and other social media platforms with the #IPAday hashtag."

Meanwhile, here's  what's planned for today by a few participating breweries in Atlantic Canada:

• Would Greg Nash miss IPA Day? He's brewed up something special that will be pouring at the [Rockbottom](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) in Halifax: [Oak-Aged Double Hoppelganger](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2013/07/ipa-day-oaked-aged-double-hoppelganger.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter). This DIPA has an ABV of 10% and a calculated IBUs of 305, with tons of Summit, Chinook, Centennial, and Magnum hops. As expected, no growler fills on this bad boy.

• And, moving on, Nash also brewed up something hoppy for the [Hart & Thistle](http://www.hartandthistle.com/). Toning it down to 7% ABV, the [Old 87](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2013/07/old-87-ipa-ipa-day-release.html) (an American IPA) has about 50 IBUs and showcases lots of Columbus and Falconer's Flight hops, heavy in both flameout and dry-hop additions.

• Off the mainland, the [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) will be showcasing the IPA all day at their brewery in Charlottetown. Their original 1772 will be available on tap and in bottles, of course, but the brewers have also concocted two cask versions to serve to Islanders looking for more of a hop fix.

We'll be enjoying several IPAs later today... don't let us be the only ones! Prepare your palates for some shredding, and celebrate the wonderful world of hops.
