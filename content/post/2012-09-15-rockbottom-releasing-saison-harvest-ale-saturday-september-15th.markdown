[Rockbottom Brewpub's Saison Harvest Ale](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2012/09/saison-harvest-release-saturday-sept.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed:+RockbottomBrewersBlog+%28Rockbottom+Brewers+Blog%29), a local-source wet-hop farmhouse ale, will be released Saturday, September 15th at 11:30 am.  The beer was brewed with 3 varieties of locally sourced fresh hops and topped off with additional fresh hops from Quebec.   The beer is described as:


<blockquote>Oh so spicy and refreshing, almost demanding you to have another. The wet-hops shine through with floral, green, vegetal and spice notes reinforcing the spicy esters created through fermentation by this very special yeast. Time to enjoy the fruits of the season!</blockquote>
