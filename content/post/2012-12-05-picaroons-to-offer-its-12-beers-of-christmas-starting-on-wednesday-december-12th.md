[![picaroons_12beersofxmas](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/picaroons_12beersofxmas.jpg)](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/picaroons-to-offer-its-12-beers-of-christmas-starting-on-wednesday-december-12th/picaroons_12beersofxmas/)

Picaroons will be starting its 12 beers of Christmas on Wednesday, December 12th (the first beer will be announced at noon on that day).  A different beer will then be available for growler fills ups at the Brewtique for the following 11 days.

While the list of beers isn't available, I hear that there will be some old favorites from last year and some new ones added to the mix.  Keep a close eye on the [Picaroons facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/picaroons?fref=ts) and their Twitter feed ( @picaroons ) for updates on what beers are available and when.
