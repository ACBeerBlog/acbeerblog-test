Good morning! We've got a bit of beer news for you this week (as usual), just in time to end off your October...

• Today, [Garrison Brewing](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) is releasing the second beer in their Star Trek-themed series, just in time for this weekend's Halifax sci-fi convention, [Hal-Con](http://www.hal-con.com/). _Vulcan Ale - Genesis Effect_ is a "Red Session IPA" that has been hopped with **Comet**, **Galaxy** and **Warrior**. Described as "hoppy and spicy" by brewmaster Daniel Girard, this 5.4% ABV beer will be jointly released in the U.S. by [Shmaltz Brewing](http://www.shmaltzbrewing.com/) (out of upstate New York), in the [Federation of Beer](http://www.federationofbeer.com/) line of officially licensed Star Trek beers. It's available in 650 mL bottles at the brewery, all four private liquor stores in the city, and select [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/Pages/ProductAvailability.aspx?ProductId=1022311) stores. Also out in celebration of Hal-Con is _Raspberry Ginger Ale_, hitting the shelves today as well.

• In other Garrison news, we have some more details on the _Gastronome IPA_ they brewed as an exclusive release at [harbourstone sea grill & pour house](http://www.marriott.com/hotel-restaurants/yhzmc-halifax-marriott-harbourfront-hotel/harbourstone/5470933/home-page.mi). _Proud Rose-Mary_ was inspired by the restaurant's Chef Trevor Simms' approach to food, and features the addition of fresh orange juice and rosemary. It comes in at an ABV of 6.5%; you can find it on tap now at the harbourstone. Look for the _Gastronome_ beer to change quarterly, in conjunction with the menu changes at the restaurant.

• [Movember](https://ca.movember.com/) starts Sunday, and [Quidi Vidi Brewing](http://www.quidividibrewery.ca/) in St. John's are releasing a special beer in collaboration with [Fogtown Barber](http://www.fogtownbrand.com/), to celebrate the hairiest of months. _Fogtown Lager_ will be released 2pm Sunday afternoon at Quidi Vidi, during a "Shave Down" event to kick off the month, complete with food from [Mallard Cottage](http://mallardcottage.ca/web/location/) and live music. For those that sign up to the [QV Mo Team](https://ca.movember.com/team/2024961) before Sunday, they'll receive a free Fogtown Lager t-shirt (while supplies last), and if they raise more than $250 before the end of Movember, a free hat, in addition to other great perks. Check out the details on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/495500700630560/). The beer itself is a 5% ABV pale lager featuring **Crystal** hops, and will be hitting the shelves and taps in St John's and region beginning Monday.

• The [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) is getting ready to release their next barrel-aged beer. The beer is named _Hell Street_, and is their _Reanimator_ Doppelbock that has spent some time in the PEIBC barrels. It has been bottled, capped, and wax-sealed, and is all ready for its official release next Thursday at the brewery. PEIBC also tapped _Scared Wit-Less_ earlier this week, their latest cask at their tasting room; it's described as a 7.5% ABV Pale Ale that has had coriander and chamomile added, to boost the spicy and flowery aromas and flavours.

• [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) released a new beer of sorts yesterday at the Brewtique - _Gourd Browny_ is a reiteration of their _Connell Stamp_, an English Brown Ale. Hopped with **Fuggles** and **Goldings**, and infused with a "special blend" of pumpkin pie spices from local bakery/cafe the [Chess Piece](https://www.facebook.com/ChessPiecePatisserieCafe/?fref=ts), this one is available only for growler fills at the Brewtique, while supplies last. And Picaroons is looking to hire a manager to run their Uptown Saint John location, which will be opening in 2016. Send along resumes to [beerguy@picaroons.ca](mailto:beerguy@picaroons.ca).

• Good news for [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) fans - they're now officially selling some of their beers in bottles! Both their _Commons_ (Bohemian Pilsner) and _Do-Gooder_ (American Pale Ale) are available for purchase in a 500 mL format at the brewery (starting today at noon) for takeaway, and should follow at PEILCC stores later next month. Look for their _Rhuby Social_ and _White Noize_ to follow in the near future, along with other seasonals to be brewed over time.

• [Spindrift Brewing](http://spindriftbrewing.com/) will be opening the doors at their storefront at [21 Frazee Drive](https://www.google.com/maps/place/21+Frazee+Ave,+Dartmouth,+NS+B3B,+Canada/@44.7141566,-63.5852724,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4b5a26e38adc9e9f:0x16e457a5dd8b4178) in Dartmouth this Wednesday. From 11am-6pm, they will be celebrating their grand opening with schwag, samples, cans, and growler fills of their _Coastal Lager_. Drop by to meet the gang, and get a peek inside the brewery. Going forward, their storefront will be open Monday to Friday, 11am-6pm for all of your Spindrift needs.

• The crew at Halifax's [Good Robot](http://wroughtironbrewing.ca/) may have been assimilated and replaced by actual robots after their acquisition by [AB InBev-SAB Miller](https://twitter.com/GoodRobotBrew/status/658642664183701504), but at least they've been keeping busy in the brewhouse! There are a pair of experimental brews available now, only on tap at the brewery. _Damn Fine Coffee and Cherry Pie Pale_ is a light-bodied and -hopped beer, with loads of cherry character in a golden package. The second beer is _de la Rocha_, a habanero dark ale, with intense chile heat, again with a light body, and no discernible hop character. Both brews are Beta versions, so be sure to drop by and give the beers a try, and share your feedback with the 'bots. For those with young ones (or young-at-heart), the brewery will be decorated for Halloween tomorrow, and there will be tricks and treats for visitors of all ages.*

• There is a new brewery in the development and licensing process coming to [Port Rexton, Newfoundland](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Port+Rexton,+NL,+Canada/@48.3891369,-53.3531215,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4b745616084d9f31:0x7ea1b7c96ffab1d3). Alicia MacDonald and Sonja Mills had been working towards opening a brewery in Truro, NS, but while visiting Mills' family in Newfoundland, they fell in love with the area and possibilities for a brewery. There is still much to be done, including an environmental assessment of their location and securing final funding, but we are looking forward to trying Port Rexton Brewing Co. beer in their brewhouse next summer.

• There will soon be a pair of different Craft Beer Advent Calendars available in our region. Much like a traditional chocolate or gift advent calendar, the idea is to get a new surprise every day during the first few weeks of December. The [Craft BeerAdvent Calendar](http://www.craftbeerimports.ca/craft/beeradvent-calendar.php) will feature 24 craft beers from across Canada and the US. Though the beer list is secret (no spoilers, please!), we do know that none of the beers are otherwise for sale in our region, and many of them were brewed specifically for the Calendar. Craft Beer fans are sure to find some new favourites in the box. The calendar will be available at [select NSLC locations](http://www.mynslc.com/Pages/ProductAvailability.aspx?ProductId=1020756) and [NLC](http://www.nfliquor.com/) locations in the next couple of days, so be sure to drop by your local store to grab one.

• And if one new brew a day isn't enough for you, some of the private beer stores in Halifax are putting together their own Advent Calendar. Drop by [Cristall Wine](http://www.cristallwinemerchants.com), [Harvest Wines](http://www.harvestwines.ca/store/), or [RockHead Wine and Beer Market](http://www.rockhead.ca/) before November 20th to reserve your calendar, for pickup November 30th. The 24 beer in these are a mix of local, domestic, and international beers for a true taste of the World of Beer.

• [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) has confirmed that they will be holding their **Second Annual Homebrew Competition** on January 17th, 2016. This BJCP-certified event will focus on [Strong Scotch Ale](http://bjcp.org/2008styles/style09.php#1e) (aka Wee Heavy), a full-bodied, deeply malty, strong Scottish beer style. Brewers will be limited to two entries each (two 12 or 16 oz bottles for each entry required), and entries will be due on January 15th; they can be shipped or dropped off to Hammond River in Quispamsis. Prizes will be given to the top three beers, and the winning entry will also be brewed as a full-size batch on HR's system; of course, the winning homebrewer will be invited to assist with brewing this batch! Each entry costs $10; get brewing, homebrewers!

That's just about all we've got this week... have a fun (and safe) Halloween tomorrow! Look for [North Brewing's](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) _Strong Dark Belgian_ to make its return shortly. Karl Whiffen from [Uncle Leo's](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/) dropped by Halifax brewery [Unfiltered](http://unfuckingfiltered.com/) this week; we'll let you know what they brewed up shortly. [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) underwent an expansion this week, to make room for more capacity in the brewhouse. [Celtic Knot's](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) _Caledonia_ 70/- seasonal is back on tap in the region. Look for it in Moncton and Saint John at your favourite watering hole. And a reminder to drop by [Port City Royal](http://www.portcityroyal.com/) tomorrow at 2pm for the tapping of an aged cask of [Hammond River's](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) _Sterke Monnik_, their 10.3% Belgian Quad.
