Without a doubt, the most interesting person you'll come across on the Atlantic Canada beer scene is brewer extraordinaire Greg Nash.  The [man simply known as "Nash"](http://www.thechronicleherald.ca/business/54727-brewer-has-unique-formula-success) has been described as "[some sort of demi-god](http://www.bartowel.com/board/viewtopic.php?p=99005)" and as a[ "hop genius" with "a national reputation for uncompromising, assertive, slap-you-in-the-face hoppy beer — he loves his hops and it shows"](http://www.planetsmag.com/story.php?id=548).

Nash and I have exchanged emails in order to complete the following Q & A:

Atlantic Canada Beer Blogger (ACBB): Tell me about yourself .

**Greg Nash (Nash): I was born and raised outside Amherst NS in a little place called Nappan, we had a cattle farm down the road with a few other critters which were eventually replaced with Christmas trees and blueberries. I worked through a few professions before discovering the passion of great beer and brewing. That led me to working on craft brewery installations in the New England States during the early '90s. I was really intrigued at this point so I set off to the American Brewer's Guild for my formal training. After graduation and several years of brewing abroad I moved to Halifax and still call it home.**

** The American Brewers Guild (now based out of Vermont) was a fabulous experience no matter how you look at it! Sunny California, a ton of hard work and a ton of great beer and fun. The instructors and management were incredible, the President is still my go-to guy whenever I'm stumped with anything beer related.**

ACBB: What breweries have you worked at over the years?

**Nash:  I apprenticed in three breweries in the Sacramento, Ca area ('The Rubicon', 'Sunrise At The Oasis' and 'Sacramento Brewing Co.') before moving to Green Bay for a couple years to work at a small microbrewery with a pub attached: Egan Brewing Company.  I made it to Lambeau Field a few times. The owner of the brewery held multiple season passes and I was lucky to get the leftovers! The games were amazing as is the city particularly on game day, a city-wide tailgate party ensues.**

**I also worked at the River City Brewing Company in  Winnipeg Manitoba, before moving to John Shippey’s Brewery in  Halifax, followed by Propeller, Garrison, Pump House, the Hart &  Thistle, Rockbottom Brewpub **also did stints at 'The Queen Molly' in Yarmouth (now Rudders) as well as a few others as consultant for staff training, brewing technique, recipe formulation etc. **
**

ACBB: You're a member of what beer related groups / associations?

**Nash:  I'm a member of several home-brewing clubs including the local [Brewnosers](http://brewnosers.org/). I'm also a member of the [Brewer's Association](http://www.brewersassociation.org/) and the [American Brewer's Guild.](http://www.abgbrew.com/index.htm)**

ACBB: How do you juggle your time as Brewmaster between Hart & Thistle and Rockbottom Brewpub?  Do you know of anyone else who is Brewmaster at two different microbreweries?

**Nash: There has to be other brewers out there working for more than one brewery, how they handle is a good question! So far it's been fairly easy to manage but summer is approaching, I have been training a couple local brewers to step in and help with the workload on the soon-to-be busy waterfront. Working weekends is getting old quick!**

ACBB: What are your future plans for your brews / career ?

**Nash:  My only plans are to keep on brewing good beer [covering all the flaws with hops for as long as I can](http://www.onbeer.org/2011/05/savouring-canadas-hoppiest-beer/)! 0_o**

**['Day of Wreckoning' ](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.com/2012/02/day-of-wreckoning-march-8th-2012.html)is fast approaching which is the release of our Imperial Stout at Rockbottom Brewpub on March 8th at 5:00 PM. I'm sure there will be more fun beers and collaborations at some point in the not-so-distant future.**

ACBB:  How do you come up with your ideas for new beers?

**Nash:  I draw a ton of inspiration from the home-brewing community, once a homebrewer always a homebrewer! There's a ton of online resources to peruse as well but when I want to brew something different with herbs, spices, fruits or other odd ingredients I think of how the flavours interact more from a food standpoint. Most people don't think of Brewers as Chefs but really that's what we do: we're liquid Chefs.**

ACBB:  Are you planning on being at any beer festivals / conferences this year?

**Nash:  I will but I'm still on the fence as to which ones!**

ACBB:  How many different brews would you say you've brewed professionally and as an amateur?

**Nash:  As a homebrewer with a ton of thirsty friends in rural Nova Scotia I logged close to 600 batches before I finally packed up to head to brewing school. Since then I brewed somewhere around 1000 - 1100 batches professionally. As for how many different styles of beer I have made, I'm not sure really. There's 30 or more style categories, I'm sure I've hit most of them and several of their sub-categories over the years.**

ACBB: Are there any awards you wanted to mention regarding your brews?

**Nash:  Awards can be rewarding and I have won several but at the end of the day the real reward and satisfaction is in watching people enjoy the product, they are effectively voting with their wallet.**

ACBB: What do you like to do in your spare time?

**Nash:  Currently most of my time is spent working in one way or another but when I have spare time I relax with the culinary arts. I cook, often, usually with beer or hops infused somehow. Charcuterie, coffee roasting, espresso making, BBQ. Mmmmmm. Okay ya got me, [I love food. And beer.](http://eastcoastbychoice.ca/2009/10/09/greg-nash-beer-and-food-advocate/)**
