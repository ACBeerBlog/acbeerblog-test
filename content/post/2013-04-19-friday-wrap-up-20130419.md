Hello Atlantic Canadian Beer Fans! Another busy week, with lots more to come. Here's your Friday Wrap-Up:



	
  * A reminder that the launch party for [Big Spruce Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing)'s beers in the HRM will be held Saturday at the [Wooden Monkey](http://www.thewoodenmonkey.ca/), Dartmouth location. The event kicks off at 7pm, with samples of their Kitchen Party Pale Ale and Cereal Killer Oatmeal Stout. We hope to see you there! For more up-to-the-minute details on when the brewery is open for growler sales, Big Spruce is now on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BigSpruceBrew).

	
  * [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) has announced that their third beer, Strong Dark Belgian, will be available at the brewery starting today. With flavours of dark chocolate, and dark fruit, this 8% beer is a welcome addition to their line-up. Their current hours are Wed-Sat 12-7pm, though it's best to check [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BridgeBrewing) for any "Out of stock" notices.

	
  * Next Wednesday, April 24th, [Picaroons](http://www.picaroons.ca/) will also be having a launch party for their highly successful Dooryard, an American Wheat Ale, one of their two summer seasonal beers. From 4-7 pm at the York St. Train Station in Fredericton, the party will feature live music, wood-fired pizza, and free Dooryard samples.

	
  * And a reminder that their Prohibition Repeal Party at Wilser's Room is tonight. 12 taps of their beer, and there may even be some barrel-aged goodies as well! The event starts at 7pm, with [Gypsophilia](http://www.gypsophilia.org/) taking the stage at 9:30.

	
  * In Halifax, a reminder that the [Rockbottom brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) has a special beer every Saturday, tapped at 1pm. Served gravity-fed on the bar-top from a pin (20l), this week's is the American Pale Ale with an extra blast of Cascade Hop Oil. Brewmaster [Greg Nash](https://twitter.com/__NASH__) loves to try a special twist on his regular lineup and seasonals, and it's different every week.

	
  * Down at the[ Hart and Thistle](http://www.hartandthistle.com/), the Commissar Russian Imperial Stout is gone :( but that means there is room for Nash's latest creation, which is a dry-hopped IPA, launching in a few days :). Check their [twitter](https://twitter.com/HartandThistle) for details on the exact release.

	
  * The Saint John Beer Festival, which was held last Saturday, appears to have been a great success. The event was sold out, and feedback was very positive, according to  organizer Peter Stoddart (also of the Saint John Ale House). Almost $2000 was raised for Ducks Unlimited.
A popular vote was held to determine the best beers of the festival. With over 150 ballots cast, the results were as follows:
Gold - Picaroons Oak-aged Winter Warmer (in Glenora cask)
Silver - Big Tide Sandpiper Pilsner
Bronze - Shiretown Blonde du Quai
With a tentative date of April 5th being planned for next year's event, Stoddart says that organizers "will be working diligently to up the bar once again".

	
  * Speaking of Saint John, [Big Tide Brewing](http://www.bigtidebrew.com/)'s newest seasonal is still available, their Double IPA. This one is only available at the pub, so you have to be a local to get it.
