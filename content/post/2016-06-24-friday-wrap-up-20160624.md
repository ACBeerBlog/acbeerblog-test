Welcome to the weekend, and it's looking like a nice one! The start of summer doesn't appear to have slowed down local beer news in any respect, so let's get to it...

• Attention Central Newfoundland beer fans, there's a new brewery scheduled to land in your region very soon! The brainchild of three avid homebrewing pilots, [Scudrunner Brewing](http://www.scudrunnerbrewing.ca/) will be opening soon in Gander. Looking to bring well-made beer to their home base, they will be focusing on brewing flavourful and interesting styles for the local community on a 6hl system. Follow along on their progress on their website, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/scudrunner), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ScudrunnerBrew) pages, as they work towards opening before the end of the year.

• [Downeast Beer Factory](http://downeastbeerfactory.com/), located at [612 Windmill Rd](https://goo.gl/maps/7QkzhWe5F322) in Dartmouth, will be launching their house-brewed beers this weekend. While their restaurant and bar have been open for a month and a half, their 18 hl brewhouse took a little bit longer to get up and running. Drop by tomorrow from 11am to grab a pint or growler of their 4.5% ABV _Fiddler’s_ Irish Red Ale, or 6.0% ABV _Game Changer_ IPA. In celebration, Downeast will be donating $5.00 from every bill to the Children's Wish Foundation.

• [Mill Street Brewpub's](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) new St John's location held their Grand Opening this week, and launched the first of their beers produced onsite. Brewed on a state-of-the-art 10 hl [Caspary](http://www.caspary.com/en/pub-brewery.html) system, _Longshore Porter_ is the first Mill Street beer produced on the island. Weighing in at 4.8% ABV, this dark amber brew features strong caramel notes from the Carafa and Munich malts (on top of a Pale base), with a balancing bitterness from [Clear Valley Hops](http://www.clearvalleyhops.com/) **Cascade** and **Chinook** to 35 IBUs. Burton Ale yeast was used for the fermentation, for a light fruity ester profile and good attenuation, and a dry finish. Their second beer is conditioning now, and will be available late next week. _Capelin_ Session IPA features **Cascade**, **Chinook**, and **Pacific Gem** in the boil, along with lots of **Cascade** and **Mosaic** hops added after fermentation. Named after the Capelin fish that can be caught as they [swim into shallow water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ6augQZHRE), this Session IPA is the perfect refreshment while waiting for the day's catch, due to the low ABV despite layers of hops (for about 50 IBUs). The house-brewed beers join the dozen other Mill Street products on tap, a rotating list of which can be purchased to go in growlers. They join the 130+ beers available at the adjacent [Bier Markt](http://www.thebiermarkt.com/st-johns/) location.

• Fredericton, your wait is over... [Gray Stone Brewing](http://graystonebrewing.com/) has officially announced the opening date for their brewery/taproom! Next [Friday, July 1st](https://www.facebook.com/events/1042024689237858/), the 10 BBL (~11.5 hL) brewery will open the doors at their [221 King St.](https://goo.gl/maps/dFXdPRxw3zq) location downtown, starting at 11 am and continuing until midnight. Featuring a brewing team of four local brewers (Ian DeMerchant, Mark Budd, Steve Christie, and Ryan Placktis), Gray Stone will be launching with two beers: _Patagonia Pale Ale_, a light-to-medium-bodied APA with a "bold tropical flavour and aroma", 5% ABV and 160 theoretical IBUs; and _Black IPA_, strongly hopped, with "mild roasted malt character and pine/citrus flavours", and clocking in at 5% ABV and 127 IBUs. The taproom will feature 24 taps; in addition to Gray Stone brews, many other New Brunswick beers will be showcased on a rotating basis. The Canada Day opening will feature plenty of beer, food, and games as a kick-off to summer! After the launch, their regular hours will be Monday-Thursday 11am-11pm, Friday-Saturday 11am-12am, and Sunday 12pm-7pm. They will be filling growlers in the future; details are still TBA.

• [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has released the third beer from their first homebrew competition, the Black Box Challenge. _Hop Springs Eternal_, a White IPA, was the first runner-up in the comp, brewed by local homebrewers Mark Reid and Sean Ebert. With a malt bill comprised of over 30% Wheat, and "hopped generously" with **Columbus**, **Cascade**, **Willamette**, and **Pacifica**, expect plenty of fruity, citrusy character in the aroma and flavour. Fermented with "an obscure yeast strain", the beer weighs in at 5.4% ABV. You can find it at the brewery, at select tap accounts and all four private liquor stores in Halifax, and in growlers at the [Halifax Seaport Market](http://www.halifaxfarmersmarket.com/) and [Alderney Farmers' Market](http://www.alderneylanding.com/market/index.html) on Saturdays. And in other Boxing Rock news, they've also re-released their _Professor McDougall's Oban Heather Scottish Ale_, brewed in collaboration with local homebrewer Jason McDougall, and _Bottle Blonde_, a Blonde ale featuring a healthy dose of rye malt in the grain bill. Look for more details on all three beers at [BR's blog](http://www.boxingrock.ca/sna/2016/06/blog_post/all).

• [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) has released a new Pale Ale, _Summit APA_. Hopped entirely with the **Summit** variety, this 4.7% ABV, light-coloured beer has characteristics of garlic and onion in the aroma and flavour, as is typical for this particular hop. Joining it is a fresh batch of their _Primetime APA_; both beers can now be enjoyed in the hot sun on their newly-opened patio, or purchased in growlers to go. As usual, food trucks will be serving up delicious treats at the taproom location both today and tomorrow.

• [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/) has announced a major expansion, including a move to [40 Water St.](https://goo.gl/maps/BHzdkyMbyrm) in downtown Windsor, where they will be brewing on a repurposed10 BBL, copper brew house. The new location will feature a retail space and taproom with a patio; with 6 taps dedicated to Schoolhouse beers, and another six to other Nova Scotia craft breweries, the local beer selection in Windsor will definitely see a bump! Renovations are planned to start on July 1st, with brewing commencing hopefully by early November. Plans are for the retail store to open in December, with the taproom following next Spring. Congratulations to the Schoolhouse family, and as always, we'll keep you updated on their progress! In the meantime, they have announced that their beers are now available on tap at [Saint-Famille Wines](http://st-famille.com/) in Falmouth.


• Petit-Pacquetville's [Distillerie Fils du Roy](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/) has launched a pair of new beers recently. Late last week, they launched _Lady Chaga_, an Acadian Pale Ale (inspired by the English IPA style), featuring the locally-harvested Chaga mushroom. Described by Fils du Roy as being very hoppy and bitter, with notes of citrus and a nutty finish, this amber-coloured beer clocks in at 7% ABV and ~60 IBUs. This beer is available exclusively at [La Brokerie](https://www.facebook.com/Labrokerie/), a bar in Caraquet, though there may be a keg available elsewhere very soon (cough[JamesJoyce](https://www.facebook.com/The-James-Joyce-Pub-187205728006725/?fref=ts)cough). In addition, this week saw the launch of_ Gougou_, a cranberry-infused beer. This 7% ABV Fruit Beer was inspired by the writings of Samuel de Champlain, who spoke of the Gougou, a monster who would terrorize the native inhabitants of the Baie des Chaleurs. This special brew is only available at [La Terrasse à Steve](https://www.facebook.com/La-terrasse-%C3%A0-Steve-224060114365004/), a seafood restaurant on Miscou Island. Finally, look for the return of _La Messe Blanche_, their 7% ABV Weizenbock, which was bottled earlier this week.


• [Propeller](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released the latest beer in their One Hit Wonder series - _June Bock_. A Maibock (aka Helles Bock), this style is a pale-coloured, malty, strong German Lager. Propeller's take on this classic style features Two Row, Pilsener, Wheat, Munich malts, and is hopped solely with **Hallertauer**. The resultant beer is 6.8% ABV and 35 IBUs, and features a moderate bitterness, slight floral hop flavour, and a bright golden colour, according to the brewery. As always, it's available in a limited supply, so get down to either Prop Shop location to fill your growlers ASAP! It will also likely pop up on tap at a few select locations in Halifax, shortly.

• [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) just released a new SMaSH (single-malt and single-hop) beer, _Horton Ridge SMaSH_. With a grist made up entirely of [Horton Ridge](https://www.hortonridgemalt.com/) Pale Malt, the 5.4% ABV beer was hopped with **Amarillo**, a crowd-favourite variety that's big on grapefruit and citrus. Available at the brewery for growler fills now, and should be following on tap at better beer bars and restaurants any day now.

• Now that the new [Authentic Seacoast Distillery and Brewery](http://www.rarebirdbeer.com/) facility has officially opened at [75 Ferry Lane in Guysborough](https://www.google.com/maps/place/75+Ferry+Rd,+Guysborough,+NS+B0H+1N0,+Canada/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4b5ceb841dd5c573:0xff6815284247ce0e?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUro6iwL_NAhXENpoKHW1nCEsQ8gEIHTAA), we have some more information to share: they have christened their new 35 hl brewhouse, so expect to see product from the new system hitting shelves in the next month or so. The brewhouse will also be creating the mash for their line of GLYNNEVAN whisky. Hours of operation for their tasting room are 11am-6pm daily, with tours running at 2pm throughout the summer.

• [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/) has welcomed a new brewer for the summer - Andrew 'Esty' Estabrooks, former brewmaster at [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/), will be brewing at the Edmundston brewery over the next couple of months, to help with the transition on the recently-expanded brewery and taproom... which means, more Petit-Sault beer! Speaking of, their beers are now heading to Nova Scotia for the first time, with their Amber Ale, _Louis XVII_, having the honour of being the first brand! Look for it at [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/) stores across the province shortly.

• [Lazy Bear Brewing](http://www.lazybearbrewing.ca) has confirmed that they will be opening their retail location on Thursday, June 30th, from 5-8 pm. Located at [120 West Old Post Rd](https://goo.gl/maps/c2uew6gYER22) in Smiths Cove, NS, this will be a "soft opening", with current plans being to open every Thursday thereafter. Growlers (1 L swing-top) will be available for purchase, and both of their first-release beers will be pouring; of course, they will happily fill clean growlers from other breweries as well! They will also be attending the [CD release show](https://bearriverarts.wordpress.com/2016/06/20/ramshackle-scarecrow-cd-release-july-2/) for Ramshackle & Scarecrow at the Sissiboo Coffee Bar in Smiths Cove July 2nd, pouring their beer. They are now available in Halifax at the Lord Nelson's [The Arms Public House](http://thearmshalifax.com/), and will be on tap at [East of Grafton](http://www.eastofgrafton.com/) on Argyle when they open June 29th.

• [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) and Boxing Rock brewed up a pilot batch of a new Blonde recently, and it is available in Nyanza now. _Wigged Out_ is a 5.0% ABV blonde ale, featuring late addition **Cascade** hops for a low bitterness, but aromatic character, for an extremely quaffable beer. It is only available on tap at their tasting room this weekend, so be sure to drop by for some, and grab some food from [Cruisin' Cuisine](https://www.facebook.com/ccft2015/) food truck, who are there 12-7pm daily Fri-Sun.

- [Grimross](http://grimross.com/) has launched "Phase One" of a series of expansions; they appear to be embiggening their taproom and retail space currently, and promise that canning of their beers will be commence in the near future.
