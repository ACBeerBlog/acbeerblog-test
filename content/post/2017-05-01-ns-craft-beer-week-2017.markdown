The third annual [Nova Scotia Craft Beer Week](http://nscraftbeer.ca/craftbeerweek/) is nearly upon us! It is presented by the Craft Brewers Association of Nova Scotia, whose member base includes 34 breweries from across the province. With events scheduled May 5-14 and from Sydney to Yarmouth, we thought it would be helpful to put them into a Calendar that can be added to your favourite app/phone, and a Map to help plan out your travels for the week.

As always, if we've missed an event, please hit us up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ACBeerBlog), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ACBeerBlog/), or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ACBeerBlog/), we are @ACBeerBlog on all of them, and we'll add it to our list. Use [#NSCraftBeerWeek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nscraftbeerweek?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash) to stay on top of the latest goings ons. Be sure to say Hi! if you see Aaron or Chris (or both, on Wednesday at [The AXEcellent Trivia at Timber Lounge](https://www.facebook.com/events/117050082177931/)!). Cheers to Local Beers!
