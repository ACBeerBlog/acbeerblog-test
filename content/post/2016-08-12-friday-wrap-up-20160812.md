Happy Friday everyone! We've got news about the newest brewery to launch in our region, as well as much more on two new NB breweries launching this fall. Plus our usual rundown of the new beers hitting the taps and shelves in our region. It's another chock-full edition of the blog!

• Moncton-based [Beckwith Road Brewing](http://beckwithroad.com/) has launched this week, with a pair of their beers now available on tap in town. Founded by cousins Mark and Mitch Symes, Beckwith Road is named after the farm their family has owned for generations, north of Moncton. Mitch is the brewer, currently using a 1/2 BBL (50L) system, while scouting out locations and equipment for possible expansion in the future. Mark is no beer slouch himself, taking the Ultimate Three Month Beer Road Trip with his dog across North America earlier this year, clocking more than 22,000km. During that time, he explored the best that beer has to offer, and both cousins are working hard to bring that to Beckwith Road's offerings. They have launched with two beers, _Boston George_ and _Aunt Martha_. _Boston George_ is a hybrid of their favourite styles, Pale Ale and IPA, straddling the line in both alcohol and bitterness, at 6.3%ABV and 53 IBUS, respectively. Named after their grandfather's cousin, it features floral and fruit notes, including banana, mango, pineapple and citrus on the nose and flavour. _Aunt Martha_ is a 4.3% ABV, 31 IBUs, American Blonde Ale, named after their aunt who enjoys light lagers, and they have brewed an approachable beer for craft and industrial beer lovers alike. Light hopping from **Chinook **and **Palisade** round out the light body and crisp finish. Both beers are currently on tap at the [Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) on Main Street, and will be joined by _Campfire_, a 5.2% ABV, 40 IBUs, American Amber early- to mid-next week. The use of Pale Chocolate and Crystal Malts impart some roast and sweet character, with notes of caramel being offset with light hopping from the **Cascade**, **Centennial**, and **Nugget. **Congratulations on the launch, and welcome to the wonderful world of Atlantic Canada Beer!

• Two weeks ago, we reported on [Fundy Bay Brewco](https://twitter.com/fundybaybrew), a new brewery planning to open soon in the town of [Sussex, NB](https://goo.gl/maps/k6ogMgyRQgo). After talking to Paul Robertson, one of the three people who have been working on opening the brewery since last October, we can now confirm that they will be starting out by brewing on a 2 BBL (225 L) [Blichmann](http://www.blichmannengineering.com/) system. A small tasting was held for local Sussex residents in early July, where their three core brands - an American IPA, Belgian Dubbel, and Session IPA - were sampled (for more info on these beers, check out our [previous post](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/07/29/friday-wrap-up-20160729/)); initial plans also involve the release of 1-2 seasonals per season. Their plans right now are to supply local bars and restaurants with kegs, which should hopefully begin sometime in late fall of this year, with the opening of a taproom to follow sometime later. As always, we'll keep you updated on their progress!

• Rumours have been circulating for months, but it was officially confirmed earlier this week that [Foghorn Brewing Company](http://www.drinkfoghorn.ca/) will be opening this fall in Rothesay, NB. Located at [47 Clark Rd.](https://goo.gl/maps/ick5Gt2Psy42), the brewery is co-owned by Business Manager Steve Russell and Andrew 'Esty' Estabrooks, who will also serve as brewmaster. The 7 BBL (~800 L) brewery will have an attached taproom for patrons to enjoy a pint and fill growlers to go. Information is a little slim at the moment, but follow along with their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/drinkfoghorn/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drinkfoghorn) accounts as development progresses, and we'll be sure to post a Q&A with them in the near future.

• After an incredibly busy first week, Digby's [Roof Hound](http://roofhound.ca/) is releasing their second beer this weekend. With just a bit of _Lil Pup_ Pale Ale left (but more coming soon!), _Rooftop Rye-It_ is making its debut. Featuring a load of rye malt for a pleasant spicy character, this 4.8% ABV beer is full bodied and a great complement to the pizzas and sandwiches coming from the kitchen (both prepared with dough made on-site with a touch of beer in the recipe). Drop by daily from 11am.

• There's not one, but two new beers available now from Nyanza's [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/). First up is _This is Complexified_, a big, bold Baltic Porter. A dark beer fermented cool with Bohemian Lager yeast, it was then cold-conditioned for an additional 4 weeks, and then split into two barrels: Bourbon barrels from Buffalo Trace, and Glenora single-malt whisky barrels. Aged for four months, then blended, the result is a beer that puts the "complex" in Complexified (a perfectly cromulent word)! Your options to try this 11.5% ABV monster are limited: either at the brewery for samples and Yapper fills, or you might be able to get a pour at one of three Halifax establishments - [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/), [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/), and [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) - all of which received/will receive a single, 20 L keg.

• Next from Big Spruce is _Dawn Wit Berries_, a "Belgian Strawberry Witbier". Conditioned on 150 lbs of organic strawberries from local [Wings of Dawn Farm](https://www.facebook.com/wingsofdawnfarm/) in Debert, NS, it was fermented with the Fruity Witbier yeast strain from [Escarpment Labs](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/), described as producing "lots of complex fruity esters" to go along with the classic Witbier coriander character. This easy-drinking beer will be available at the brewery and at establishments serving Big Spruce beers; at 4.8% ABV and 17 IBUs, it's a perfect session ale for summer. Drop by this weekend for the "Farm to Fork Food Truck Weekend", featuring [Cruisin' Cuisine](https://www.facebook.com/ccft2015/).

• Accidents happen in brewing, as in life, and sometimes they work out for everyone! [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) is no exception to this rule, as they proved recently with a new beer, _The Fermenter Has Been Drinking_. While brewing their _Tom Waits For No One_ Stout, their kettle burner took a turn for the worst, resulting in a lower-gravity wort for fermentation (meaning less alcohol after fermentation). Not to be outdone, the brewing team added some cold-brewed [Java Blend](http://javablendcoffee.com/) Sumatra Gayo coffee, giving a dark-brown beer with notes of roast, dark chocolate, berries, and wood in the aroma and flavour. This American Stout clocks in at 6.7% ABV and 60 IBUs.

• There's yet another new beer being released at [North](http://www.northbrewing.ca/), _Horton Single Malt_. This Belgian Specialty Ale was brewed entirely with Vienna malt sourced from [Horton Ridge Malt and Grain Co.](https://www.facebook.com/hortonridgemalt/?fref=ts), and dry-hopped with **Cascade**. Fermented with the Old World Saison Blend (featuring two Saison strains) from Escarpment Labs, it weighs in at 7% ABV. Expect a blend of both fruit and spice, with a dry finish. Look for it to be released today at both their Agricola and Ochterloney locations, and on tap around the HRM.

• There's a new beer now pouring from [Lazy Bear Brewing](http://www.lazybearbrewing.ca) - _Sissiboo Stout_ was brewed with a variety of both Chocolate and Roasted malts, as well as some oatmeal to boost the mouthfeel. Added to the brew was a portion of Honduran-sourced Tobiatic Wild from local [Sissiboo Coffee Roaster](http://sissiboocoffee.com/); cold-extracted and added after fermentation was complete, this medium-roast coffee contributes a pleasant level of roast flavours (without being overpowering), as well as a slight hint of orange peel, according to the brewery. A small amount of an unnamed hop variety was added near the end of the boil to complement this orange peel character. This 5.5% ABV, ~30 IBUs beer is available this Saturday at the [Annapolis Royal Farmers' Market](http://www.annapolisroyalfarmersmarket.com/) for growler fills, and will likely show up on tap around Digby in the near future.

• [Bore City](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/) has released an interesting new beer, _Fricot_, an homage to a [popular Acadian dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fricot). To accomplish this, potatoes were added during the mash, as well as the Summer Savory herb at the end of the boil. This hazy, pale-to-golden-coloured ale was hopped with **Hallertau Blanc**, and fermented with a "fruity Belgian yeast strain", for a real blend of flavours! Best-described as a Belgian Golden Strong Ale, it weighs in at 7.1% ABV and 39 IBUs, and will be on tap exclusively at [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/).

• [PEI Brewing Company](http://peibrewingcompany.com/) has put on a brand new cask in their tap room, the brainchild of brewer Spencer Gallant. The _Lactic-Soured Peppercorn Wheat _builds on the _Sir John A_ Wheat base, but with a sharp, tart character, and pleasant fruit and earth peppercorn flavour and aromatics. This 4.5% ABV, 12 IBU brew is only available for sale at the brewery via handpump, so drop by today for a taste!

• Halifax's [Unfiltered Brewing](http://hoppyasballs.ca) is bringing back an old favourite, with a new twist. _All Falc'd Up!_ Double IPA returns today at noon. This SMaSH of 2-Row Malt features [Falconer's Flight 7C's](https://ychhops.com/varieties/falconers-flight-7cs) hops, a special blend of citrus and fruit-forward hops developed as an ode to Pacific Northwest brewing legend Glen Hay Falconer. The brew was fermented with Vermont Ale yeast for more tropical aromatics, finishing out this 7.5% ABV, 100+ IBUs beauty. Grab a pint or growler of it today from noon!

• Port Williams' [Wayfarers' Ale Society](http://www.wayfarersale.ca/index.html) has released a fourth beer this week. _EPA_ is a traditional 5.0% ABV English Pale Ale, favouring a medium malt backbone with a touch of bitterness (coming in around 30 IBUs). Light esters give a pleasant fruity character, completing the English experience. It joins the _Thistle Dew_ Scottish Ale, _Hellene_ Blonde and _Ruby _Irish Ale for a full complement of European and UK-inspired beers.

• Attention, [Johnny Jacks](https://www.facebook.com/johnnyjacksbrewery/) fans - their beer will soon be hitting select ANBL stores! The Oromocto-based nanobrewery will first be bottling their _Trench Fighter IPA_, followed by their _Viking Ale_ and _Smokin' Amber_. Look for the first bottles to hit the Oromocto ANBL outlet by early fall, with Fredericton and Saint John stores following shortly thereafter. The brewery has recently ordered two 1.5 BBL (175 L) fermentors to keep up with production, so look for more JJ beers to be available soon (including a special, bottle-conditioned beer brewed just in time for Christmas!). In the meantime, their beers can be found on tap at the [Sour Grape Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/sourgrapecafe/?fref=ts), [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/The-James-Joyce-Pub-187205728006725/?fref=ts), [Gray Stone](http://graystonebrewing.com/), and the [Cask & Kettle](https://www.facebook.com/caskandkettle/).

- Don't forget to drop by [Tatamagouche](http://tatabrew.com/) for bottles and growler fills of one of their many new releases this week/weekend. Check out [last week's post](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/08/05/friday-wrap-up-20160805/) for the full rundown, and grab some food from [The Food Wolf](http://www.thefoodwolf.com/) food truck, set up today 12-8, and tomorrow 11-7.

- For those who had a chance and loved it, or missed out, Fredericton's [York County Cider](http://www.yorkcountycider.net/) has revealed that their unnamed cider, currently pouring for on-site samples only, is _Ribes nigrum_, aka Blackcurrant. Drop by for more, and fill up on growlers of their multiple offerings.

They have also replenished their bottles of _IPA_ at the brewery, so there are two great reasons to visit!
