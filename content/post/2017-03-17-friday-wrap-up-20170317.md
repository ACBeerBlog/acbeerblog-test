Happy Friday, and happy St. Patrick's Day! If being a Friday wasn't a good enough excuse to drink, now you have two reasons! But before you reach for that beer (stay away from food colouring!), let's take a few minutes to get caught up with our local beer news...

• The 2017 [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) - the 5th year for the fest - was a huge success, and - as we can personally verify - one hell of a good time! With two sessions on Saturday, there were 58 breweries pouring over 220 beers, ciders, and meads, 5200+ L of beer served to ~1,750 people. Thanks to organizer Lloyd Chambers and 50 loyal volunteers, everything went smoothly, proving that the festival does indeed improve with every year. Several other events were also going on through the week (and even into Sunday), with plenty of beer lovers turning out to take part. This was also the first year for the [Down East Brewing Awards](https://www.facebook.com/events/398717783803804/), which had close to 140 different beers and ciders entered by commercial breweries in Atlantic Canada. The winners were announced at the FCBF afternoon session, and Fredericton's [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) took home Brewery of the Year, thanks to winning three gold medals and Best of Show (check out the link for the full list of winners). Congratulations! Thanks again to everyone who helped to make FCBF such a success, and we'll see you next year, with a date of March 10th already set! And don't forget to vote for [Best of the Fest](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YFK8HWR), rewarding your favourite breweries that attended this year's event.

• Attention Newfoundland Beer Fans! [Split Rock Brewing Company](https://www.facebook.com/Split-Rock-Brewing-Co-1633920973580854) is coming soon to Twillingate, on the island's Northeast shore. Allison and Matt Vincent are residents of the town, and were living and working away from home for several years. In the mid-2000s, while living in Halifax, they caught the craft beer bug, and began homebrewing. Starting with wine and beer kits, they graduated to brewing All Grain in 2010, and haven't looked back since. Like many avid homebrewers, the idea of starting a brewery in their hometown was always in the back of their mind, but at that time, just a dream. An opportunity for Allison to move back home in 2014 brought them back to Twillingate, and, as Allison puts it, "with the tourism industry booming and many young people moving home, we knew it needed a microbrewery!" Local businesspeople Tim and Robin Vatcher share their vision to bring a growth industry back to the region, and are helping to bring Split Rock Brewing Co to fruition. Brewmaster Matt will be brewing on a 500 litre (4 BBL) system from [Colorado Brewing Systems](http://cobrewingsystems.com/), capable of a full brewday in only four hours, with 3800 litres of fermentation capacity for a wide variety of beers on the go simultaneously. Speaking of which, they are fans of brewing (and drinking) English-style beer, and will be launching with a variety of those, including a Bitter, Red Ale (with Rye), Brown Ale, Stout, and IPA, as well as a Belgian Witbier and Cream Ale. Split Rock will be hitting the local taps late spring; stay tuned to their social media and here for the full scoop!

• Down in Digby, NS, [Roof Hound](https://www.facebook.com/roofhound) has taken taken one of the truly formative steps in the life of a young brewery by hiring an assistant brewer. [Magen Powell](https://twitter.com/magsthemaven) is a veteran of the restaurant industry where she has worked on and off since she was 19 years of age, serving, bartending and managing. Her stint with Nova Scotia draught and tap experts [BeerTech](http://www.beertech.ca/) helped her develop a solid technical understanding and the skills needed to install and maintain dispensing systems. This also helps her bring another perspective to brewing in terms of how beer and other carbonated liquids behave and the influence of different gases (CO2, “beer gas”, Nitro, etc.) in dispensing. Magen’s first foray in the brewhouse is the Dive Bar Classics series, beginning with the _Mojito Dry-hopped Sour_ that was released on March 4th. This series reflects her passion for being a “bar chef” and her interest in craft cocktails featuring local ingredients. The next in the series, _Fuzzy Navel IPA_ was brewed this week and you can expect it to debut in April. We’ll be sure to get more details about that one as the release date approaches.

• Meanwhile, Roof Hound is also putting on something special for your St. Patrick’s day celebration today - they’ve taken their _Handsome Devil Coffee Milk Porter_ and jazzed it up with almonds, vanilla bean and Irish Whiskey. The result is 7% ABV and there’s only one keg of it down at the brewery. So if you’re in the Digby area tonight and fixing for something dark, smooth and sweet, this one sounds like a good bet!

• In other St. Paddy's Day beer news, Fredericton's [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) just released _The Leprechaunundrum_, a dark, bitter, 6.5% ABV ale that doesn't appear to fit into any particular style of beer. Described by the brewery as "dry and full-bodied, yet fruity due to the generous amounts of **Galaxy** hops", it's now on tap at all Picaroons locations across New Brunswick, and may pop up at select bars/restaurants in the near future.

• [Bulwark Cider](http://www.bulwarkcider.com/)’s special People’s Cider Project is ready for prime-time! We first mentioned it in [October](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/10/14/friday-wrap-up-20161014/), when they put out the call for folks with hobby orchards, abandoned orchards, or just some apple trees on their property to bring apples to [Ross Farm Museum](https://rossfarm.novascotia.ca/) for [Cider Days](https://www.facebook.com/peoplesciderbulwark). The original hope was simply that enough cider would be made to share with all the apple-givers who were issued People’s Cider Memberships in exchange for their apples. In the end things went a whole lot better than that and the first community-driven cider project in Nova Scotia (at least in recorded memory) is a great success. _The People’s Cider_ has arrived and was launched this week. A rustic cider coming in at 7.8% ABV, it features aromas of apple blossom, pear, and clover honey and has a crisp, dry finish. Given the many varieties of apples it contains, some of which have surely been all but forgotten, it expresses true _terroir_; future versions are bound to be different, but this is your chance to taste the very first. Available in 500ml bottles, you’ll be able to find it at the private liquor stores in Halifax as well as the NSLC Port of Wines store. If you’re not in Halifax, or even in Nova Scotia, and you want to get your hands on this special batch, fear not! Bulwark has now launched an [online store](http://bulwarkcider.com/store) shipping cider and branded merchandise country-wide. This is great news for both Bulwark and cider fans across the land; now if only breweries were allowed to do the same thing…

• After a brief hiatus, Dartmouth's [Spindrift Brewing](http://spindriftbrewing.com/) has brought back their _Killick_ Session Lager this week, but in a big way. The 4.7% ABV Munich Helles-style beer, originally released as _Kinobier_ [last fall](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/10/21/friday-wrap-up-20161021/) to celebrate [Devour! Film Fest](http://devourfest.com/), is now available in six-pack format. The Helles ("Bright" or "Pale") style is a traditional German style of beer, known to be supremely drinkable, and the local version does not disappoint. Featuring Heidelberg Malt as the sole grain, and a light bitterness from **Herkules** hops (with **Huell Melon** for aroma and flavour), these ingredients keep the beer authentically German. Six-packs are available **now** at the brewery and at [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) on the Halifax waterfront, and debuting at the NSLC Monday, April 3rd. And in an update for you _Blueberry Chai Pils_ fans (or soon-to-be fans), packaging of this beer will be happening early next week, with release mid-next-week at the brewery, and with the standard Spindrift Tall Boy cans debuting at the NSLC April 3rd.

• Moncton's [Tide & Boar Brewing](http://www.tideandboar.com/) is holding another **Growler Day** today, with a pair of beers available to go. _Method IPA_ is a hazy and juicy, orange hoppy beer with lots of citrus and peach notes, according to the brewery. Clocking in at 7% ABV, the brewery assures us it's "new and improved"! T&B's latest sour beer will also be pouring - _Sour Otis Tangelo Oranges_ features, yes, tangelo, a citrus fruit that is a hybrid of tangerine and grapefruit. The details stop there, but assuming this beer follows the trend set by the others in the Sour Otis series, it was likely kettle soured to give plenty of tartness to complement the character from the fruit addition.

• We've got lots of news to share about [Sober Island Brewing](http://www.soberislandbrewing.ca/), who are putting the final touches on their major expansion at their brewery (new building, and a 820 litre (7BBL) brewhouse, up from 50 litre). They expect to be brewing on the system before the end of the month, which means an April launch. In the meantime, however, they will be adding a brand new beer to their core lineup, a _Blonde Ale_ very soon. Described as a "bread and butter sort of beer" by owner Rebecca Atkinson, the easy drinking brew uses a different yeast than the rest of their year-round offerings, low in hop profile, but with plenty of character. The approachable beer is meant to introduce local drinkers to the wonderful world of small batch beer. First sips and samples will be available at the [Musquodoboit Harbour Farmers' Market](http://www.mhfarmersmarket.ca/) this Sunday.

• This week's edition of [The Coast](https://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-coast/20170316), Halifax's alt-weekly, is beer-centric, so be sure to grab it to learn about what local brewers are drinking, an interview with Propeller Brewing's John Allen, and some suggestions for St. Patrick's Day drinking from the [902BrewCast](http://www.902brewcast.com/) guys. Speaking of which, they have released their **March Tasting Episode** this morning, so be sure to grab that in your favourite podcasting method.

• The annual [Saint John Beer Fest](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest) is coming up fast (**Saturday, April 8th**), and [Flying Boats](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710) will be attending with a brand new beer in tow. Brewed in collaboration with local beer writer Craig Pinhey, it's being stylized as a "hybrid Amber Ale" brewed to feature the Special B malt. Known for imparting raisin-like, dark fruit characteristics when used in brewing, Special B is more often seen in dark, Belgian-style ales. Flying Boats' beer also has NB-grown **Cascade** hops added for bittering and flavour, and will come in at around 29 IBUs and 5.5% ABV. If you can't make it to the SJBF - there are a few tickets [still on sale](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/saint-john-beerfest-2017-tickets-29607005350), by the way - fear not! This one will also be on tap at Flying Boats accounts.

• The NB maple beers continue to flow, as [Foghorn](http://www.drinkfoghorn.ca/) just released their take on the style. Described by the brewery as a "Maple Rye", _Xylem_ has a subtle maple flavour thanks to the addition of 20 L of maple syrup from local producer [Briggs Maples](https://www.facebook.com/BriggsMaples1/). Hopped to 35 IBUs with **Southan Goldings**, giving a moderate bitterness in the finish. The beer weighs in at 5.7% ABV, and is available now for pints and growler fills at the brewery's taproom; keep your eyes peeled, as it may pop up on tap at your favourite Foghorn licensee, soon. And keep an eye out for more Maple Beers, launched as a [Tourism NB partnership](http://www.tourismnewbrunswick.ca/See/FoodAndDrink/Maple.aspx) between maple producers and brewers. Also on the list is [Distillerie Fils du Roy](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/)'s _Monseigneur Paquet_ collaboration with their Pacquetville neighbours, Sucrerie Chiasson.

• In Nackawic, you’ll find [Big Axe](http://www.bigaxe.ca/) putting out their _Maple Bourbon Porter_, a 5.4% ABV brown porter with a light to medium body and a mild bitterness. The maple syrup for this beer came from [Dumfries Maples](http://dumfriesmaples.ca/) across the river. Bourbon-soaked oak chips were added to the secondary along with a second shot of maple syrup. Continuing the maple theme, Big Axe will also be doing their annual _Maple Wheat Amber_ as soon as the sugaring season starts, with their usual partner Stone Family Maple Products providing the syrup for that one. We’ll update you on that one as the season goes on.

• And speaking of Fils du Roy, they will be releasing a new beer next weekend, as part of an event in Bathurst. _Capt. Craig_ Brown Ale is a 5.5% ABV, 28 IBU beer named after famous/infamous Capt Craig, a maurader in the Baie de Chaleur, and whose phantom ship is thought to sail the Baie to this day. [Le Soiree Noir & Blanc](https://www.facebook.com/events/1808646899400911/) is a fundraising supper happening in Bathurst **Mar 25th**, in support of food security and assistance for the region's youth. After the launch, bottles of the beer will be more widely available at the region's ANBL locations.

**In addition to today's excuse to grab a few pints at your local, we've got a few more reasons to celebrate local: **

• Happy One Year Anniversary to Fredericton's [York County Cider](http://www.yorkcountycider.net/)! Drop by their retail location at 418 York Street **this afternoon** from 4-7pm for free sampling, snacks, and prizes.

• Wolfville’s [La Torta Pizzeria](https://www.facebook.com/LaTortaPizzeria/) will be hosting a very special event tomorrow, **Saturday the 18th**, their first (we think!) [tap takeover](https://www.facebook.com/events/391185271259474/), as [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) comes in from the North Shore. Twelve, count 'em, 12 taps will be flowing with Tata’s signature brews starting at 2pm. There will be door prizes, swag, live music featuring Steve Lee, and no cover charge. The tap list has been slowly revealed this week via social media, with taps [1-4](https://www.instagram.com/p/BRqZZhAhMEW/) showcasing the lighter side and taps [5-8](https://www.instagram.com/p/BRtXPdahlAj/) banging the hops. Taps 8-12 are yet to be revealed; check [Tata’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/TataBrew) throughout the day for the announcement. And plan to bring an appetite, as La Torta’s Neapolitan-style wood-fired oven will be in full swing.

• [PEI Brewing Co.](http://peibrewingcompany.com) will be holding a special [Tap Takeover at HopYard](https://www.facebook.com/events/401747976860732/) on **Saturday, March 25th**, where they will be launching their dry-hopped Brett Saison. Aptly named _Patience_, this beer was brewed almost six months ago. With a grist of 2-row, Munich malt, and wheat, it was fermented with a Saison strain, as well as the wild yeast strain _Brettanomyces_, which can continue to develop funky flavours and aromas when given enough time. Once it was about ready, it was then dry-hopped with the tropical **Citra** and **Mosaic** varieties, and primed (carbonated) in the bottle for several weeks. This is the first Brett (and bottle-conditioned) beer for PEIBC, so be sure to grab a few bottles when you can! Aside from the PEIBC tap takeover, the event will feature lots of live music, as well as a limited edition menu collaboration with Chef Jane Crawford and Chef Adam Loo. Bring your appetites! It all starts at 4 pm, with no cover.

• On **April 2nd** (rescheduled from March 25 due to shipping issues), Halifax's [Stillwell Beer Bar](http://www.barstillwell.com/) will be hosting a BC Brewery Tap Takeover, featuring 3 heavy-hitters from the West Coast: [Brassneck Brewery](http://brassneck.ca/) in Vancouver, [Four Winds Brewing](http://fourwindsbrewing.ca/) from Delta, and [Dageraad](http://dageraadbrewing.com/) of Burnaby. Featuring a wide variety in styles of beer, including Brassneck's _Changeling_ Raspberry Sour, Four Winds' _Featherweight_ Session IPA, and Dageraad's _Sri Lanka_ Dubbel. No tickets required for the event, and the doors open at noon. For the full taplist, check out the [Brewnosers Forums](http://brewnosers.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10818&p=150713#p150659) for the salivating details.

• Now that FCBF is over, it's time to start planning for the next beer-themed Fredericton event - [Poutine Fest](https://www.facebook.com/events/1196866927087133/)! Scheduled for **Saturday, April 29th**, like past events it will feature three different sessions, with two of them (late afternoon and evening) pouring over 12 different beers, ciders and meads. There are different ticket options which determine the number of drink tickets you receive (click out the link for details); of course, all tickets include all-you-can-eat poutine, with 12+ different varieties being available! [Tickets go on sale today at 11 am](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fredericton-poutine-festival-2017-tickets-32840448666?aff=FB); the event has sold out every time since its initial launch, so be sure to grab yours ASAP.

• And if summer doesn't feel too far away for you, we have news on a new festival coming up! The first [Big Axe Craft Beer Festival](https://www.bigaxefestival.com/) will be held in downtown Nackawic, NB on **Saturday, July 15th** from 4-8 pm. Organized by Peter and Tatiana Cole of [Big Axe Brewery](http://www.bigaxe.ca/), exact details are still being ironed out, but there will be 20+ breweries from NB, NS, PEI and Maine on hand, as well as live music (including [David in the Dark](https://www.davidinthedark.com/)), and food vendors offering "an assortment of foods grown and sourced in NB". Tickets are already on sale, and are $50 each; there is also a limited-availability $65 option, which includes a bus ride to and from the festival from Fredericton or Woodstock. Breweries confirmed so far include Grimross, Maybee, Hammond River, Picaroons, Sober Island, Foghorn, Upstreet, Petit-Sault, Red Rover, Sunset Heights Meadery, and Portland, Maine's [Urban Farm Fermentory](https://www.fermentory.com/). Be sure to buy your tickets ASAP, before they're gone!

**And before we go this week...**

- [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) will have their _Dave & Morley Coffee Brown_ back on tap as of today in version 2.0 form, this time featuring **Rwanda Kanzu** (from [Java Blend](http://javablendcoffee.com/), of course) as the coffee component. So pull up a stool, order one up, and maybe lift your glass to the late, great Stuart McLean, who inspired this brew. Meanwhile, the gang has installed their [Buffalo Trace](http://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/) whiskey barrels and will shortly be pouring things into them; we'll let you know what when the appropriate time comes.
- [Mill Street St John's](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) has brought back their _Jigger's Delight_ Cali Common (5% ABV, 14 IBUs), a hybrid between lager and ale that is described as "fresh and zingy, with medium body and toasty caramel notes".
- Needing a [Nine Locks](http://www.ninelocksbrewing.ca) _Fathom_ fix? Good news, it's back in cans again! This 8% ABV DIPA recently won a medal in the Down East Brewing Awards, so stock up while you can!
- Picaroons has announced that they're looking to fill two brewing positions, one at the Saint John brewery, and one in St. Stephen. Both breweries are 2.5 hL in size, double-batching into 5 hL. For a full list of qualifications and contact info, check out this [link](http://picaroons.ca/were-hiring-now-looking-for-brewers/).
- The region's Homebrewers, especially those in the HRM, will be excited to hear that [Everwood Avenue Brewshop](https://www.everwoodavebrewshop.com/) is relocating out of owner Dave Gillette’s basement and into a retail space in Lower Sackville. This will mean regular retail hours six days a week, and only closing on Mondays. The space is roughly twice as large and will allow the shop to expand its product lines and better cater to different market segments. We’ll have more details before the expected opening on **April 5th**, but for now can tell you that they’re looking for a full-time employee for the new space. You can find the details of the position posted on the [Brewnoser’s forum](http://www.brewnosers.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=45&p=150711).
