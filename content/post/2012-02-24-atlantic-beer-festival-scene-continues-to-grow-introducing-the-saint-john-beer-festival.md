[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/saint-john-beer-fest.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/saint-john-beer-fest.jpg)The Atlantic Canadian beer festival scene continues to grow with the latest edition being the [Saint John Beer Festival](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/beerfest).   The inaugural event will take place on April 14th from 7-9:30 at the Market Square Atrium.  Tickets, which are $49.50 each,  will be limited due to the size of the location and are available at the Harbour Station box office.

I'll post more information about the event as it becomes available.  Check out their [Facebook page ](http://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest?sk=wall)and follow them on Twitter (@SJBeerFest) for more information.
