Happy Friday y'all! We are deep into August now, and the weather in our region has been gorgeous, which bodes well for a healthy hop and grain harvest next month. Let's take a minute to toast the hard working farmers and growers who keep the brewers fully stocked with great ingredients!

• [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) is on the lookout for a Head Brewer! Having expanded several times during their first three years in operation, they are looking for an experienced brewer to join their ranks, and help them keep up with the great demand for their beer across the province (and beyond). In addition to day-to-day brewing tasks, familiarity with Quality Control, recipe development, cellaring, and maintenance are also requirements. As in all breweries of this size, the ability to wear many hats, and communicate with co-workers in the brewhouse is key! If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, check out the [full job posting here](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tata_Head_Brewer.pdf), and fire off an email to [Matt Kenny](mailto:mkenny@tatabrew.com).

• Wolfville's [Annapolis Cider Company](http://drinkannapolis.ca/) released the latest cider in their **Something Different** series on the weekend,_ Raspberry and Rooibos_. This 6.7% unfiltered sparkling cider begins with a dry cider base fermented over Red Delicious skins, blended with fresh juice from local, handpicked, raspberries. The blend was then cold-conditioned with Red Rooibos loose leaf tea from their neighbours at Just Us! Coffee. The resultant deep pink cider showcases a tannic structure, with plenty of fresh raspberry flavour and aroma, and a light earthiness from the tea. As with all of their Something Different releases, Annapolis is donating $0.50 from each sale to a local charity, with the [Wolfville Children's Centre](https://sites.google.com/site/wolfvillechildrenscentre/home) being the current beneficiary.

• 90 minutes down Highway 101 from Wolfville is Smiths Cove, home to [Lazy Bear Brewing](http://www.lazybearbrewing.ca). They have upped the ante this week with the release of _Sour Punch_ Kettle Sour. Featuring a similar hop profile to their _Punch_ Session IPA, this 5.0% ABV Pale first underwent a controlled souring using _Lactobacillus_, before finishing fermentation with an ale yeast. During conditioning, it was generously dry-hopped with **El Dorado**, **Idaho 7**, and **Olicana**, for "a nice balance of tart and tropical fruity from those hops", according to the brewery. The best way to grab _Sour Punch_, and its little sister _Punch_ (which we understand will be back shortly), is at Lazy Bear's Thursday evening Growler nights, and at their [Annapolis Royal Farmers & Traders Market](http://www.annapolisroyalfarmersmarket.com/) stall Saturday from 8AM.

• [Think Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/thinkbrewing), in New Brunswick's Southwest region, has added a new beer to their roster, featuring all New Brunswick hops. Named after the area in which they are located, _Tweedsider_ Pale Ale features 2016 harvest **Centennial** and **Columbus** hops from [Southan Farms](https://www.facebook.com/SouthanFarms/) and **Cascade** hops from [Lakeview Farm](https://www.facebook.com/Lakeview-Farm-1597997393745829/) in Think's neighbouring town of Harvey. Described as a "Classic 'C' hop Pale Ale", with Columbus as bittering and plenty of late Cascade and Centennial for a bright citrus fresh aroma. The area of Tweedside got its name after the [River Tweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tweed) in Scotland. _Tweedsider_ can be found on tap at [The Loch](https://www.facebook.com/TheLoch/) in Harvey (also adjacent to where those Cascade hops were grown), [Cask & Kettle](https://www.facebook.com/caskandkettle/) in Saint John, and [Graystone](http://graystonebrewing.com/) in Fredericton.

• Over on the western side of PEI, [Moth Lane](https://www.facebook.com/MothLaneBrewing/) has a new beer available, this one with a name derived from folklore. Called _Sidehill Gouger_, apparently after a creature said to roam the dunes next to the brewery that has evolved shorter legs on one side of its body, it’s a wheat and barley beer brewed with an American yeast. At 5% ABV and 11 IBU, it should have a clean flavour profile and a refreshing character, perfect for the tail end of summer.

• HRM’s [North Brewing](http://northbrewing.ca/) sees the release of the second beer in their **Finite Series** today, with the launch of _Oh My Darlin_, a Clementine Pale Ale. Coming in at 6.3% ABV, it’s been in development for quite some time. Leveraging a stainless tank from Battery Park, it underwent a secondary fermentation with _Brettanomyces claussenii_ for six months before being dry-hopped with **Mandarina Bavaria **and packaged into bottles and kegs where it conditioned for another 1.5 months. Described as dry , with a "brilliant" brett funk and notes of clementine, this is an extremely limited release, with only 850 bottles (650 mL) and 3 kegs produced in total. As of **noon today** you’ll find it at both North bottle shops, and on tap at [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/) and [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) as long as it lasts. So if you love the funk, you know what to do.

• Things are coming together for [Split Rock Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/Split-Rock-Brewing-Co-1633920973580854/) in iconic [Twillingate, NL](https://goo.gl/maps/33B8xwtuvF82), with their opening fast approaching. As they count down the weeks and days until launch, they are looking to expand their team, looking for bartenders and servers for their on-site taproom. If you are looking for an excuse to go back home, or want a new adventure where you can [watch icebergs](http://icebergfinder.com/) and [whales](http://www.twillingate.com/toseedo/whales/) from behind the bar, get in touch with the Split Rock family in person at 119 Main Street or via [social media](https://www.facebook.com/1633920973580854/photos/a.1715129655459985.1073741831.1633920973580854/1715129638793320/?type=3&theater).

• Down Digby way in Nova Scotia, [Roof Hound](http://roofhound.ca/) is ready to begin another new era for the brewery with the impending arrival of bottles to the packaging mix. Their first offerings in this format will be the _Sweet Little SIPA_ session IPA, at 4.5% ABV, and their aptly-named (for all the right reasons), _Big Stink IPA_ at 6.4% ABV. They’ve gone with the swankily retro 500 mL stubby format and if you check out social media you’ll see their cunningly designed counter pressure bottle filler. Speaking of social media ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/roofhound/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RoofHoundBrewCo), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/roofhound/)), that’s how you’ll best find out when these puppies (yes, we went there) will be available; they’re still technically waiting on NSLC approval after obtaining the nod on recyclability. Once they’ve got clearance, you’ll find the bottles available at the brewery and in the city at [Bishop’s Cellar](https://bishopscellar.com/) for now, with other avenues potentially developing over time.

• If you’re keeping score on the wonderful things that have already come out of the foedres at [2 Crows Brewing](https://www.2crowsbrewing.com/), you’ll have likely notched a win for the [Low Point](https://www.facebook.com/lowpointcoffee/) Barrel-aged Burundi Coffee. If you’ve idly wondered what that lovely stuff might taste like if someone had the presence of mind to brew some up and put it in a beer, it turns out you’re not alone. Halifax’s [Tidehouse Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tidehouse-Brewing-Company-Limited/1820582331511159) got their collective grubby paws on some of that lovely coffee (no doubt at the mental, emotional, and possibly physical expense of Jeremy Taylor) and put it into an American Porter they’re calling _Low Tide Foedre-aged Burundi Coffee Porter_ (you will be forgiven for ordering “Low Tide”). The grist for this 5.5% ABV brew was comprised of a 2-row malt base, Carafa II for color, and Pale Chocolate malt for roasty and chocolate notes, while the hop side features **Magnum** for a present, but only just, bitterness, and **Bramling Cross** for some red fruit and lemon flavour. Ideally this will provide an excellent platform for the sweet, boozy and vanilla components of the coffee. Release is expected to take place this coming Wednesday, **August 23rd at 1 PM**, where they’ll have a mere 350 bottles (500 mL) available, so if you’re interested, you’d best step lively - once they’re gone, they’re gone!

• And demonstrating how multiple people can have the same great idea and yet execute it quite differently, there's another beer featuring that 2 Crows/Low Point Foedre-aged Burundi Coffee available today! Debuting at last weekend's Seaport Beerfest, and now available to the public, is a little collab our very own Chris did with the fine folks at 2 Crows Brewing. _Switch Hitter_ is a 4.5% ABV American Pale Ale, featuring a light, mostly-Pilsner based malt profile, hopped to 35 IBU with **Hallertau Blanc**, and then fermented with a blend of yeasts (both clean and wild). A bit more **H. Blanc** was added during active fermentation, and the beer sat on several ounces of the foedre-aged coffee for a week before packaging. The resultant beer shows a bit of yeast-derived funkiness, with some bright hop notes and coffee flavour. With two kegs poured at the Brewnosers/Ladies Beer League **Tap Local** table last weekend, there's just one keg available at 2 Crows today, for on-site enjoyment only (aka, no cans or growlers). Be sure to chirp Chris on [Untappd](https://untappd.com/user/acbbchris) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/acbbchris) to let him know what you think...

• With the very many new [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) beers that have been hitting shelves and taps this past summer, it's actually kind of surprising that they haven't done a true SMaSH beer... until now! _Lomah_ was released earlier this week, and features a grist comprised of 100% Pilsner malt, and a hop schedule made up entirely of **Columbus**. A hop variety that every brewer is familiar with, Columbus has been around for many years, and always brings more to the table than expected. _Lomah_ in particular is described as "dank, spicy, and surprisingly tropical and fruity", and weighs in at 6.3%. Available now in cans, pints and growlers at the brewery, TW is calling it "crisp, clean, and completely crushable".

• As usual we’ve got plenty to tell you about with regards to [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) in Halifax’s North End this week. First, the summer tradition continues with yet another new brew on the Gastroturf serving as Cask in the Sun this afternoon. This time it’s _Leave Me Blue Popcorn_, their Kentucky Corn Beer with house made caramel and lactose added to push it in a caramel corn direction. Next, this weekend will see the release of an almost-new Alpha Brew, previously released as a Beta Brew by Assistant Brewer **Jake DeWolfe** as his first solo brew at GR. _El Espinazo del Diablo_ (the Devil’s Backbone, after a Guillermo del Toro film) is a Mexican Lager weighing in at 5.8% ABV and a light 14 IBU. With a grain bill of 2-row and Vienna malts and flaked corn, the noble hop **Tettnanger** for flavour, and the addition of both lime zest and jalapeño peppers for added interest, this is a light, but slightly hazy lager that should be quite refreshing. And lastly, this week’s Beta Brewsday on **August 22nd** is a collaboration between Beta system queen **Kelly Costello** and **Jana Muise** of [Motion Bay Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/motionbaybrew/) (original name: Killick Stone), soon to be open in Petty Harbour, Newfoundland. This is a hoppy one called _Stella Ella Oh La La_ with 2-row, Vienna and Flaked oats making up the malt side, for plenty of body and a little haze. On the hop side, there was a bittering jolt of **Cascade** out of the gate, and then a triple dry hop of **Citra** at 2 days, **Ella** (formerly known as **Stella**) at 4 days, and **Citra** again at 6 days! At a super-sessionable 4.5% ABV, but a healthy 56 IBU this very well might qualify as a NE Session IPA. There’s only one way to find out and that’s to be at GR next Tuesday when it’s tapped!

• [Woody Point](https://woodypoint.ca/) is located on Newfoundland's West Coast, in the heart of [Gros Morne National Park](http://pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/nl/grosmorne). That's where [Galliott Studios](https://www.facebook.com/Galliott-Studios-435614716514201/), the officially unofficial taproom for [Western Newfoundland Brewing Company](http://westernnewfoundlandbrewing.ca/), is located. The cafe/gallery/pottery studio/bar is also home to the [Writers at Woody Point](http://www.writersatwoodypoint.com/) event taking place August 15-20th. With readings by authors, live music, and celebration of written and spoken word, the event has also been the perfect time for WNLBC to release a new beer, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the [House of Anansi Press](https://houseofanansi.com/). The 3.5% ABV Ginger Wheat Ale features additions of Millet and Sorghum in the mash, as a nod to the [legend of Anansi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anansi), an African folktale. Complementing the ginger, are locally-foraged Wild Rose and Wild Mint, collected by local group Northern Food Craft. The beer is currently on tap at Galliott Studios, and we don't expect it will last beyond the weekend, so drop by today for a pint and story!

**What's on the go in the next couple of weeks?**

• Charlottetown's [Upstreet Brewing](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) is throwing their annual Block Party **tomorrow**, and it promises to be bigger and better than ever. With an open-air artisan market, the Most Wanted Pawn Shop's Retro Video Game parlour, great food, and their own sodas pouring, there is something for everybody. This free event will also feature live music all day, from noon until late night. Check out the [full details here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1806500306327827), and drop by for a right good time tomorrow!

• Next Sunday, **August 27th**, the crew from Charlottetown's [HopYard](http://hopyard.ca/) want to take you on an [Island Wide Brewery Tour](https://www.facebook.com/hopyardbeerbar/photos/a.1752630018315526.1073741829.1723755667869628/1955648664680326/?type=3)! Meeting at HopYard at **noon**, the bus will head up West to [Moth Lane](https://www.facebook.com/MothLaneBrewing/) for a visit, then it's off to [BarNone](http://barnone.beer/) for a pint, before heading back to town for a pint and bite at HopYard.

Tunes and Trivia will be on the go to keep you entertained between stops. Tickets are available at HopYard now for just $50+tax.
