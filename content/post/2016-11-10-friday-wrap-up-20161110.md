Good afternoon, and welcome to a special Thursday edition of the Atlantic Canada Beer Blog! With tomorrow's holiday, we decided to release this week's news a day early...

• [One Way Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/OneWayBrewing) is coming soon to historic Ginger House, located on Truro's [Prince Street](https://goo.gl/maps/yN6jwPKv4942). Three local entrepreneurs will be launching the small brewery in the spring, complete with an on-site tap room, as well as growler and keg sales. Brewing on a 5 hl (4 BBL) system, they will be concentrating on supplying beer fans and bars in the local market. We'll have more details closer to launch, but in the meantime check out the articles in [Truro Daily News](http://www.trurodaily.com/News/Local/2016-11-04/article-4679979/Trio-joins-forces-for-craft-beer-brewery-in-downtown-Truro/1) and [CBC online](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/one-way-brewing-truro-microbrewery-1.3838421).

• The University of Moncton's brew pub, [Le Coude](https://www.facebook.com/BarLeCoude/), has been going strong for a couple of months now, ever since [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301) has set up shop! Lucky residents of Fredericton will be seeing some AB popping up in the city, as they recently sent four different beers to the [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/The-James-Joyce-Pub-187205728006725/?fref=ts). Included are: _Valdrague Weizen_, their 5% ABV take on the classic German Hefeweizen style; _Tintamarre_, a 6.6% ABV Belgian Saison;_ La Bringue_,  a 5% ABV American Brown Ale; and _La Picasse_, a 7.3% ABV Baltic Porter that hasn't been brewed since in more than two years. As always, these beers won't last long, so be sure to [keep track of when they're being tapped](https://untappd.com/v/james-joyce-pub/421109)!

• [Mama's Brew Pub](http://www.mamaspubwesthills.com/) isn't letting the cool weather prevent them from brewing summer beer styles, as they've recently released their take on a Belgian Witbier, _White Citrus Bomb_. The grist is made up simply of 2-row malt and Flaked Wheat, and lightly hopped to 18 IBUs with **Hallertau**. Brewer Ryan Kingston also added "a cheesecloth sack the size of a basketball" full of freshly-grated orange zest (for those of you who haven't grated multiple oranges, this takes awhile!), and a small amount of coriander.  Featuring plenty of citrus aromas and flavours, as the name implies, it comes in at 4.3% ABV. And for Mama's fans who may not make it to the brewpub as often as they'd like, their Crowler machine and cans have arrived, so look for off-site sales to begin in the near future.

• Today will see the launch of the latest Greg Nash SMaSH at [Unfiltered Brewing](http://unfuckingfiltered.com). Touted as the fourth in the series (although we had counted four already: _DOA_, _All Falc’d Up_, _Deity_, and _RSMA_), _Danko_ features two-row malt and copious quantities of the **Simcoe** hop, a variety known for it’s potent, woody, musky-like-cat-pee-but-in-a-good-way aroma and passionfruit, pine and berry flavour notes. The name, credited to the brewery’s own Emily, reflects both the word “dank,” often used when describing Nash’s hop-forward creations, and Rick Danko, bassist for The Band and one of the more famous products of Simcoe, Ontario. As with all Unfiltered SMaSH beers, it comes in north of 100 IBU and somewhere in the vicinity of 7.5% ABV. Given the nature of the hop and the likely quantities involved, this is another that’s likely to flirt with some more savoury notes in flavour and aroma. You’ll have to grab a growler at the brewery or a pint (or three) at _Charm School Pub_ to find out. Get on it!

• Halifax's (and Dartmouth's) [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) is releasing a special mixed fermentation beer today. _Wiley Boys II_ is the second iteration of _Wiley Boys_ Dark Saison [first released in July](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/06/30/friday-wrap-up-20160630/), in celebration of owner Peter Burbridge's best friend's wedding. Six hundred litres of the original brew was given an extra pitch of _Brettanomyces_ from [Escarpment Labs](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/), as well as a large addition of Nova Scotia-harvested strawberries from [Beet Rouge](http://www.beetrouge.com/). This new blend was allowed to further ferment for three months, and has been conditioning for another month in bottles. The _Brett_ adds a leather-like and funky contribution, with the strawberries and underlying dark chocolate notes coming through as well. Available at both locations today, this 7.0% ABV beer is for sale only in bottles, with a special nitro-primed keg to be released at [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/)'s First Birthday Party **December 9th**. The artwork on the label is a photo taken by [Trevor Allen](http://www.trevorallen.ca/).

• Details are now available for [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/)'s annual birthday celebration beer. Brewing once again at North in Halifax, _Stillwell 3_ will be similar to last year's _Stillwell 2_, a rustic farmhouse, fermented with their "house blend" of yeasts and bacteria, however the underlying beer is markedly different. From Stillwell's Christopher Reynolds, "Traditionally, many saisons were quite bitter, quite hoppy in aroma and flavour, and bittered with high quantities of low-alpha acid hops. For _Stillwell 3_, we found some **Styrian Goldings** that were a scant 1.8 AA and used them to bitter to 32 IBU." The higher bitterness lowered the acidity, and allowed the _Saccharomyces_ yeast strains to shine through and show off more classic Saison character with fruity esters and spicy phenolics. The beer was heavily dry-hopped, and if drunk fresh will be reminiscent of traditional Saison beers from Belgium, or if left to age, the hops will fade and _Brett_ will take over, as with the famous _Orval_. The beer will be launching at Stilly's party on **November 20th**, and will be joined by a slew of beers from across the Maritimes and beyond (late update, the draught and special bottle list [has been released](https://www.facebook.com/barstillwell/photos/a.519110094829022.1073741826.519107894829242/1276182779121746/?type=3&theater)). Bottles of _Stillwell 3_ will also be available for sale at North Brewing's retail stores at that time.

• We now have the details on the [3rd Annual Hammond River Brewing Homebrew Competition](http://hrbrewing.ca/competition/), open to all homebrewers living in the Maritimes. This BJCP-certified competition will involve three beer styles: Imperial IPA (category 22A), Sweet Stout (16A), and English Porter (13C). The entry fee is $10, with any or all three styles open for entry for each participant. The first-place finisher will receive a $75 gift certificate for the [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/), and will get to assist in the brewing of their beer on the [Hammond River](http://hrbrewing.ca/) system, for release to local tap accounts. There will be 2nd and 3rd prizes offered as well. More details and entry forms can be accessed through the link above; all entries are due at the brewery by February 3rd, with judging taking place on February 5th.

• [Picaroons](http://picaroons.ca/) has announced that the taproom at their Fredericton brewhouse location ([912 Union St.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/912+Union+St,+Fredericton,+NB+E3A+3P7/@45.9587972,-66.6261943,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4ca418ae95e4b3b7:0xcbea82e05820d0f2!8m2!3d45.9587972!4d-66.6240056)) will be opening later this month. **The Roundhouse** will be serving pints of Picaroons beer, as well as other New Brunswick craft beer, cider, and mead, and will also have brewery merchandise for sale. Pairing with the taproom will be the [Real Foods Café](http://www.realfoodconnections.ca/), which will offer "an ever-evolving menu of lighter fare and grab-n-go items". Growlers will also be filled at the new location and bottles will be available for sale; when opened, expect the taproom to be open seven days a week. We'll keep you updated on the date, and hours, when known.

• You knew with everything that happened Tuesday night, there had to be an election-themed beverage produced somewhere. Well, [Red Rover ](http://www.redroverbrew.com/)must have seen the writing on the wall that almost everyone else missed, as they released a new keg of cider yesterday, _Trumpty Dumpty_. On tap at the Ciderhouse only, this 7% ABV cider was infused with hibiscus, a type of flower often used in tea, providing a tangy flavour; they also added some Thuya Gin, from New Brunswick's [Fils du Roy](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/). No word yet on if the cider is orange or angry; be sure to let us know if you're lucky enough to have a taste!

• Fredericton's newest nano-brewery, [Bogtrotter](https://www.facebook.com/BogtrotterCraftBrewery/), has released _Malty Muskrat_, their first Imperial IPA. Their biggest beer to-date at 8.2%, it was highly hopped to 100 IBUs with **Warrior**, **Amarillo**, and **Simcoe**. You can find it exclusively on tap at select locations in the city, including the James Joyce, [540 Kitchen & Bar](https://www.facebook.com/540kitchenandbar), and [Graystone Brewing](http://graystonebrewing.com/).

There's yet a few more beer-themed events coming up over the next month that we'd like to mention:


• [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) is bringing back_ Black Tie Affair_, their Vanilla Cranberry Stout, and is holding a [Rocking Release Party](https://www.facebook.com/events/1375996912445289/) to celebrate, next **Thursday, November 17th** from 6-10 pm. A three-course, Prix Fixe menu Black Tie Dinner (featuring _Black Tie Affair_ in the recipes, of course) will start the night at 6 pm, followed by live music at 7 pm. Admission is free, with donations being accepted for the [Rwanda Craft Brewery Project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beaus/the-rwanda-craft-brewery-project). While there, be sure to check out their latest on-tap-only small batch, _Berliner Weisse_ (4.5% ABV, 8 IBUs), which was kettle-soured with grain; future iterations, with various dry-hop additions, will follow.


• The second public presentation of [Sociable!](https://www.facebook.com/sociablefilm), will be taking place next **Friday, November 18th**, at [Boxing Rock Brewing](http://www.boxingrock.ca/). The party in Shelburne kicks off at 6pm with free brewery tours, with the film starting at 7pm, and following up with a Q&A with the filmmakers. Free snacks and beer samples will be available too! For more information, check out the [Event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/221222704973709/).





• The Inaugural [Cape Breton Beer Fest](https://www.capebretonbeerfest.com/) is happening **November 19th** at the Cruise Terminal in Sydney. There will be [fifteen breweries, cider houses, and distilleries](https://www.capebretonbeerfest.com/pages/become-a-vendor) from around the province in attendance for the Afternoon (2:00 to 4:30 pm) or Evening sessions (7:00 to 9:30 pm, with VIP tickets available for 6:00 pm entry). Grab your tickets online today.










• Battery Park will be hosting Nyanza's [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/) on **December 1st**, in the third in a series of _NS Brewery Tap Takeovers_. As in the previous editions with [Tatamagouche](http://tatabrew.com/) and [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/), they have also teamed up with the visiting brewery on a collaboration brew. This month's beer is a Nova Scotia-themed mad scientist's dream: a Donair Beer, aged on raspberries. The Battery Park kitchen created, cooked, then dried and powdered donair meat, and added it to the mash tun, with the grain required for an Imperial Stout. After primary fermentation, the beer will age on raspberries. _Blood Donair_ is the name of the beer, and it will debut during the tap takeover, along with plenty of Big Spruce's favourite and award-winning beers.







Have a great long weekend, and tomorrow, remember to think of those who gave - and continue to give - so much, and raise a glass of craft beer in their honour. In closing...
