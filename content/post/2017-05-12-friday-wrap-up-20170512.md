Wow, what a [#NSCraftBeerWeek](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NSCraftBeerWeek) so far! Aaron and Chris had a blast competing in the Stillwell Open last Sunday and hosting Craft Beer Trivia on Wednesday night at Timber Lounge, and everyone is getting excited for this weekend's conclusion, the [Full House Craft Beer Fest](http://localconnections.ca/home/full-house-2017) in Halifax, which will see beer from 30+ breweries from across the province! Here's your latest news on what to keep an eye open for this weekend in Nova Scotia, and across our region:

• Starting off the Nova Scotia new beers, uh, news, [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) released a couple earlier this week. _Midnight_, their Glenora barrel-aged Belgian Strong Dark Ale (aged with [Brett Q](http://www.escarpmentlabs.com/strains), a _Brettanomyces_ strain isolated from a barrel-aged sour beer from Quebec), was re-released yesterday in 650 mL bottles. This 10.5% ABV monster has notes of dark chocolate, tart cherry, stone fruit, oak, vanilla, and whisky, and is one of those beauties you know will benefit from picking up an extra or two for aging; it's available at both bottle shops. And last Sunday saw the release of _Betroth Ale_, a Braggot (think beer and mead mixture) created for North employee Brad's wedding. Brewed with honey, heather, and yarrow, this was North's [Stillwell Open](http://www.barstillwell.com/) entry last weekend. Weighing in at 5.4% ABV and 9 IBUs, it's available in bottles and for growler fills at both locations.

• Another debut at Sunday’s well-attended event was from [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/). They teamed up with homebrew collective _extraordinaire_ [Brathair Brewing](https://twitter.com/BrathairBrewing) to put together the winner in the Amber category, _Seven Years_, a New England Amber Ale hopped to the gills to produce notes of juicy tropical fruit, citrus and pine. Although more heavily hopped than Breton’s flagship _Black Angus IPA_, it’s less bitter, at only 25 IBU. And at 5.2% ABV it’s fairly sessionable, with slightly sweet flavours and soft mouthfeel contrasting with the hops to give an overall gentle impression that suggests, “maybe I’ll have another one of those…” This one won’t be canned, but it will be available in kegs and growlers from the brewery, and likely for growler fills in the HRM at some point. You’ll also see it appear at various tap accounts throughout the city as well.

• Also claiming a win at the Stillwell Open, this time in the pale category, was the collaboration between Annapolis Valley upstarts [Lunn’s Mill](https://www.lunnsmill.beer/) and South Shore stalwarts [Boxing Rock](http://boxingrock.ca/), _April, May and Juniper_, a saison style ale. This brew features juniper berries, a primary component in gin, with an aromatic profile that marries nicely with the classic French Saison yeast used for fermentation. This 6% ABV beauty sold out awfully quickly at the Open, but is available in bottles at the private liquor stores in HRM, and for growler fills at Boxing Rock’s [Seaport Market](http://www.halifaxfarmersmarket.com/) and [Alderney Farmer’s Market](http://www.alderneylanding.com/market/) stalls (both formats are available at the brewery in Shelburne, natch).

• Let's continue on with [Schoolhouse](http://www.schoolhousebrewery.ca/), who will be releasing their latest beer, _Staffroom Stout_, at this weekend's Full House Craft Beer Fest. Brewed with 40 L of cold-brewed coffee from local roasters [T.A.N. Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/tancoffeemicroroasters/), the brewery describes it as a "rich and smooth Oatmeal Stout, full-bodied with a mild coffee bitterness". Quite drinkable at 5.5% ABV, it should also be available starting today at the brewery's taproom (open 3:20-8 pm today, 11-8 Saturday and Sunday) for samples and growlers, and in bottles. Schoolhouse will also be re-releasing their previous collaboration with [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca), _Scratch Plaskett - Electric Tambourine Wheat Ale_, next Wednesday, also in bottles and on tap. And hopefully joined by their patio shortly thereafter! And be sure to drop by their booth at the Full House event Friday and/or Saturday, as they will be making a big announcement to their loyal fans!

• Debuting late last week, and pouring at this weekend's Fest, is a brand new offering from Smiths Cove's [Lazy Bear Brewing](http://www.lazybearbrewing.ca). _Brier Rose_ is a 4.5% fruit beer, featuring [rose hips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_hip) harvested from [Brier Island](https://goo.gl/maps/JKuVSZeemNH2). The malt bill uses a combination of Pale and Munich malts (totaling 85%) from Horton Ridge, and the beer was fermented European Ale yeast. The combination of fruit and malt come together for a vibrant hue to enjoy while sipping the beer. If you're not able to catch the Full House, it will also be available at their booth at the [Annapolis Royal Farmers' Winter Market](http://www.annapolisroyalfarmersmarket.com/) Saturday morning.

• Reminding us that it's not always about beer, [Annapolis Cider Company](http://drinkannapolis.ca/) has released the latest in their Something Different series. _Earl Blue_ is a blend of cool-fermented dry cider made from local apple varieties (including Golden Russet and McIntosh), along with juice from NS-grown wild blueberries, and freshly-pressed apples. Not stopping there, the blend was cold-steeped with Earl Grey tea leaves (a black tea flavoured with the addition of oil of bergamot), "to add tannins and structure", according to Annapolis. The result is a sparkling, "blush-hued cider with aromatic notes of citrus and earthy, wild blueberries that finishes with a hint of bitterness from the tea". Coming in at 6.8% ABV, it's available now at the cidery. The recipient of the $0.50 from each refill will be the [Wolfville School Playground Fundraiser](http://grapevinepublishing.ca/4487/a-new-community-park-at-wolfville-school).

• One of the grand-daddies of Nova Scotia craft beer, [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) in Halifax, announced yesterday the hiring of a new Head Brewer. **Cameron Crerar** is a native of Tasmania, Australia, where he cut his teeth as an Assistant Brewer with [Moo Brew](http://moobrew.com.au/) . From there, he travelled halfway (or more!) around the world to take a spot as Brewer with [Beau’s All Natural Brewing Company](https://beaus.ca/) in the hamlet of Vankleek Hill, Ontario. The Propeller gig is Cameron’s first as a Head Brewer and he brings with him from his previous positions a combination of creativity and large-scale brewing experience. Look for him to continue the 20-year tradition begun by Propeller President **John Allen** while bringing new ideas and interesting limited edition beers to the taps. We suspect Cameron might be somewhat recognizable by an accent…if you run into him, consider buying him a beer and asking about his celebrity beer story that features **Justin Timberlake**.

• On Robie Street, [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca/) is bringing a new beer out this week that’s geared for the hot summer weather (which we’re assuming will happen; at some point; eventually). _Koji Kondo_ named for the man who composed many of Ninendo’s classic video game themes, is a “Sake Beer” containing a preponderance of rice, with only a small portion of barley (2-row and Pilsner) in the mash. It’s also a single hop beer, leveraging the divisive Japanese variety **Sorachi Ace** for bittering and flavor/aroma in the kettle, as well as whirlpool and dry hop additions. And if that wasn’t Faaaar East Coast enough for you, the yeast used to ferment this beer is the same used to ferment _sake_, Japanese rice wine. We don’t suggest you drink this beer warm though. At 5.2% it’s fairly sessionable, and it’s certainly not a bitter bomb at a paltry 9 IBUs. What it is likely to be is an exceptionally crisp, dry, fruity and light, possibly non-beer-like beer that might be just the thing for a sweltering summer day on the Gastroturf.

• If you’ve been worried about a lack of three-brew release and double tap takeover weeks from [2 Crows](https://www.2crowsbrewing.com/), you can rest easy. Jeremy and the gang are still up to all kinds of no good, starting with the release of _In Theory_, the kettle-soured, _Brett_-fermented, dry-hopped (with **Dr. Rudi**) 5.8% ABV beer brewed with the crew from [902 BrewCast](http://www.902brewcast.com/). This pilot batch will only be available for on-site enjoyment, and at this weekend's Full House, and not much of it, so be sure to drop by today. But good news, the guys dropped by earlier this week to brew a full batch of _In Theory_, which will be available in wider distribution next month. And if you drop by soon enough, you may be able to grab a pint of _Nervous Waters_ before it kicks, a 6.6% Belgian Dubbel released during last weekend's Open Brewery Day. Also look for a couple of small canning runs of two of their seasonal beers, the _Fantacity_ (note pronunciation) Witbier and the _Midnight Mood_ porter. You’ll find these on the shelves in the fridge at the brewery as long as supplies last.

• During your drive/walk/toktok to 2 Crows, listen to the latest podcast of theirs to drop, featuring Peter Burbridge, Emily Tipton, and Brian Titus of the [Craft Brewers Association of Nova Scotia](http://nscraftbeer.ca), during which they talk about the mandate and goals of the CBANS, NS Craft Beer Week, and plans their respective breweries have for the near future. After getting your fill at 2C, take a turn towards the water and hit [Bishop's Cellar](https://bishopscellar.com/beer/), who the 902BC gang partnered with for the release of a curated 7-pack of beer, including an exclusive run of _Cedric the Great_ Double IPA from [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/).

• In bigger news, however, and news that is shared with both 2 Crows and new kids on the block [Stillwell Brewing](https://www.instagram.com/stillwellbrewing/), the next time you find yourself on Brunswick Street, poke your head in and check out the beautiful wooden vessels now on display in the brewery. These are [foeders](https://www.instagram.com/p/BT9JodjFGon/), [big-ass wooden barrels](https://www.instagram.com/p/BT9Rhz4hvAT/) previously used to age spirits. 2 Crows have four, two of which formerly held cognac and two that housed the classic French apple brandy Calvados (for 65 years!). Stillwell Brewing have two, both from cognac. And you know what folks? These things are going to be filled with beer. And then that beer is going to sit there in those barrels while we wait. And wonder. And wait. And wonder some more. Chances are it’s going to come out even tastier than it was when they put it in. And then that beer is going to be made available for sale and we are going to be a happy, happy beer-loving region. FULL STOP.

• Pivoting away from Nova Scotia now, Fredericton's [TrailWay](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) has released another brand new small-batch beer this week, their second iteration of a Hoppy Sour Ale. _El Generico_ was kettle-soured with a Lactobacillus pitch, and heavily-hopped with **Hallertau Blanc**, a German variety that has been referred to as the country's version of Galaxy. Expect notes of grapefruit, passionfruit, and a unique flowery-fruity character from this hop, to go along with the sourness and crispness of the beer. At 3.8% ABV, it's available right now at the brewery only, in cans and on tap for pints and growler fills. Expect this brew to change constantly for awhile, as the brewers at TW experiment with the hop profile.

• Beer fans in New Brunswick have likely noticed [Tatamagouche Brewing](http://tatabrew.com/) beers popping up on tap at various bars and restaurants across the province. If you've been upset you haven't been able to take Tata home with you, good news! The first Tata cans should be appearing in ANBL stores any day now. The brewery's Kolsch, _North Shore Lagered Ale_, will be the first brand to hit. While it may be awhile before other Tata beers follow, rest assured it WILL be happening!

• In St. John’s, [Mill Street Brewpub](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) has been busy getting some beers ready to go - three offerings hit their retail counter earlier this month, and have been moving to the main draught system ever since. The first was _Rowhouse_, a lager in the Czech Amber style. It features big aromas of caramel, coffee, and graham crackers in a 5.5% ABV and 12 IBU package. The subtle hop aroma from the noble continental **Saaz** variety should complement the malt flavours nicely. This one is named for the famous “Jellybean” row houses in downtown St. John’s and might be just the thing to get you through Sprinter.

• Next is the _Round Da’ Bay_, an American Pale Ale, which will hit the taps earlier this week. This style emerged as a New World adaptation of the classic English Pale and Mill Street’s version has big American hop aromas of Pineapple and Grapefruit thanks to a hefty addition of **Mosaic** hops. It’s 5.3% ABV and a fairly hefty 50 IBU, with a solid malt bill and some sweetness characteristic of the style; it’s also got a touch of wheat to smooth things out and provide some extra body, perfect for a day of dreaming about camping out “Round Da Bay”.

• And finally, we have the return of an old favourite, _RDF Hefe_. “RDF” stands for the triumvirate of Newfoundland weather, “Rain, Drizzle and Fog.” It’s 5.7% ABV and 25 IBU, same as it ever was, and is a wheat-based ale in the classic Hefeweizen style. With a bright golden color, long-lasting foamy head and classic banana and clove esters from the yeast, this is a malty and refreshing brew. They have also put together a special cask for Mothers Day, with _RDF_ as a base, but adds strawberries and partridgeberries and was primed (carbonated) with an addition of Purity Syrup! Even better, Moms can enjoy a free pour from the pin when they drop by Sunday.

**Here are the latest events on our radar:**

• The culmination of NS Craft Beer Week is the [Full House](http://localconnections.ca/home/full-house-2017), taking place at the Halifax Forum Multipurpose Room over the course of three sessions: tonight 6-9PM, and Saturday 1-4, and again at 6-9PM. 32 breweries from across the province will be pouring their best beers, with plenty of great food to keep you happy as well. We don't have to sell you on this one, we know you'll want to go! This is your chance to check off beers from across the province that are not normally available in HRM, and to chat with the passionate folks who make them. Also keep your eyes open for booths from [Mashed In Beer Gear](https://www.mashedin.beer/), [The Brewnosers](http://brewnosers.org/forums/), 902 BrewCast, and [Ladies Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/LadiesBeerDrinkingLeague/).

• If you won't be able to make it into town **Saturday** for the Full House, we highly suggest dropping by the [Townhouse Pub](https://www.facebook.com/AntigonishTownhouse/) in Antigonish to grab a pint of [Half Cocked Brewing's](https://www.facebook.com/halfcockedbrewing/) beer. Located in North Grant, and launching this summer, HC has been brewing up some pilot batch with Terry on the small system upstairs, and is debuting another one Saturday in the Pub. And of course, while you're there, be sure to grab a pint of _Terry's Bitter_, or _Stout_. Keep an eye on Half Cocked's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/halfcockedbeer) and [IG](https://www.instagram.com/halfcockedbrewing/) to find out when it goes on tap.

• Whatchagonnado on **Sunday morning** when the grim reality that Craft Beer week is over and your white charger-pulled carriage has turned back into a pumpkin hits you like the proverbial ton of bricks? We suggest you give some consideration to heading on down to Good Robot where they’re promising to [triage that hangover](https://www.facebook.com/events/229887867416262) and maybe help you get ready to face interaction with normal people again. Festivities start with [Yoga in the beer garden](https://www.facebook.com/events/746765508829845) at 11am (Yeah, 11am. You think you’re going to be up before 11? Pffffft.) From there, it’s coffee and beer pairings featuring [Bottleneck Coffee Co.](https://www.facebook.com/lowpointcoffee/) (strangely now spelled “Low Point Coffee”) and some of the most crushable and sessionable (read: low alcohol) beers from various NS breweries. [Rinaldo’s](https://www.facebook.com/RinaldosHfx/) will be there to help you get some food in that troubled tummy and there will be an oxygen bar to recondition those lungs after that pack of darts that you totally don’t remember buying. This event is “Come as you Are”: wear your hangover outfit, whether that’s bathrobe, pyjamas, loungewear, three-piece suit with tails, whatever. But come out, and lament the end of Craft Beer Week in style.

• Up on the Rock, the ladies of [Port Rexton Brewing](http://www.portrextonbrewing.com/) are planning a big presence for the BBQ tap takeover tomorrow, **Saturday, May 13th**, at the [Merchant Tavern](http://themerchanttavern.ca/) in St. John’s. A bevy of PR beers will be available, along with Texas BBQ from Toronto’s renown [Smoke Signals Barbecue](http://www.smokesignalsbarbecue.ca/), and additional libations from [Lot 40](https://www.instagram.com/lot40/) (Canadian Whisky of the Year) and [JP Wisers](http://www.jpwisers.com/ca/) while brand ambassador [Dave Mitton](https://twitter.com/davegrantmitton?lang=en) teaches a master class on Whisk(e)y. If any of those things strike your fancy, let the Merchant Tavern know, remaining bookings for this one are likely pretty low!

• As if they need to reinforce their status as utterly mad men and women, the motley crew of saucy suds slingers at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) have upped the ante once again by scheduling, get this, a Tuesday Tap Takeover for **May 16**. Seriously. Tuesday. And this isn’t some mincing, fraidy-cat, “not-sure-how-this-brewery-will-go-over-in-Halifax thing,” this is the very successful, multi-award-winning [Sawdust City Brewing Co.](https://www.sawdustcitybrewing.com) out of Gravenhurst, Ontario (“Gateway to Muskoka” is the phrase you’ll recognize if you’ve ever driven that stretch of highway). Bringing core favorites like the _Lone Pine IPA_ and _Twin Pines IIPA_, as well as collaborations that became regular offerings like _Little Norway Pale Lager_ originally brewed in Norway with [Arendals Bryggeri](http://www.arendalsbryggeri.no/), and some new school collaborations with Southern Ontario bright lights like Burlington’s [Nickelbrook](https://nickelbrook.com/), Toronto’s [Bar Hop](http://barhopbar.com/) and Ottawa’s [Tooth & Nail](http://toothandnailbeer.com/), Stillwell’s going to do their very best to get you fired on a Wednesday morning. Maybe be careful with the _Long Dark Voyage to Uranus_ (Imperial Stout, 9.5%), the _11.05_ (Belgian Tripel w/ Brett, 11%), the _Princess Wears Girlpants_ (American Saison, 9%), and the _Old Dirty Bastard_ (Barrel-aged Saison w/ Brett, 10%)? There’s lots more besides those ones, the full tap list is on Stillwell’s [Twitter](https://twitter.com/barstillwell) feed.

• The [Moncton Beer League](https://www.facebook.com/MonctonBeerLeague/) is holding their second [Flights 'n Bites: Whisky and Beer edition](https://www.facebook.com/events/145327556003377/) on **Thursday, May 25th** at [Bistro 33](https://www.facebook.com/Bistro-33-Moncton-NB-310827028952368/) in downtown Moncton, from 6:30-9:30 pm. Featuring a variety of pairings of Whisky, Scotch and Bourbon with craft beer, food items from Chef Marc Surette will also play a role. Tickets are $55 each and are [available now](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/flights-n-bites-whisky-and-beer-edition-tickets-26059088435), and also include a custom-made Belgian-style glass to keep.

• And in other MBL event news, tickets are also now on sale for the next [Urban Beer Hike](https://www.facebook.com/events/1293427507372677/), being held on **Saturday, June 17th**. This downtown Moncton walking tour will take you to five beer bars where you will sample multiple craft beer and food pairings at each location. The event runs from 1:15-5:30 pm; [tickets](https://greatermoncton.snapd.com/events/view/1046868) are $49 each. Follow along on the event page for updates as to which bars will be visited, and where to meet for the beginning of the tour.

**A few more beer-droppings to tell you about before signing off this week:
**

- [Hammond River](http://hrbrewing.ca/) has released a new iteration of their _Two Rivers_ Black IPA (originally brewed with [Big Axe](http://www.bigaxe.ca/)), with this one being hopped entirely with **Citra**. Look for this one (7% ABV, 77 IBUs) at your favourite HR tap account.
- [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/) now has their summer seasonal Witbier, _Tante Blanche_ (4.7% ABV, 18 IBUs) back on shelves and on tap in local bars, just in time for warmer weather (it IS coming, right?).
- Mahone Bay's Saltbox Brewing has canned up a small run of their _Dynamite Trail _Hefeweizen, _Holy Mackerel_ Pale Ale, and _Nun on the Run_ Cream Ale. Grab them from the brewery for the perfect cottage accompaniment, and ask for them at your favourite local establishment, including [Oh My Cod](http://www.oh-my-cod.ca/).
- There are [rumors afoot](https://twitter.com/BarStillwell/status/862012953436069888) that [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) is gearing for the opening of their Beer Garden on Spring Garden Road, possibly as soon as later this month. Stillwell Brewing is also [apparently brewing up something special](https://www.instagram.com/p/BTuPgkDhC1P/) in the lager vein specifically for the venue, and [communication](https://twitter.com/BarStillwell/status/862382232333422592) with [Backoos Korean Food](https://twitter.com/backoos) about a Beer Garden pop-up have allegedly taken place. Summer 2017 is fixing to be immense.
- [Unfiltered](http://hoppyasballs.ca)'s monster of a DIPA, _Warning Label_ (10% ABV, 100+ IBUs), has returned; big, bold, and hoppy, this batch differs from the first in that no oak has been added this time around. Drop by Charm School today to get your fill (but go easy, ok?).
