Hey, everyone! Here's what's happening in the craft beer world in Atlantic Canada this week (and beyond)...

• [Big Spruce](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) is brewing up a Black IPA/India Black Ale **today**. With a medium body, using imported organic [Carafa Malt](http://www.weyermann.de/eng/produkte.asp?idkat=29&umenue=yes&idmenue=0&sprache=2) and [Sinamar](http://www.weyermann.de/eng/produkte.asp?idkat=194&umenue=yes&idmenue=0&sprache=2) for colour, the beer will showcase a great citrus flavour and aroma (thanks in no small part to their on-farm-grown Cascade to be used for dry-hopping), and will weigh in at a whopping 124 IBUs! We are looking forward to try this one in three weeks.

• On Monday, a bit too late for our Hop Harvest-centric [post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/friday-wrap-up-20130830/), [Sea Level](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) brewed up their popular New Scotland Heather Ale, made with all NS-grown hops and heather (from their own [hop farm](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/hop-farm/) and others in the Annapolis Valley). Look for it at [The Port Pub](http://www.theportpub.com/) (on tap and at the brewery) and in Halifax at [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) soon.

• Two new beers from [Celtic Knot Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) should be available soon: both the Dark Passage Oatmeal Stout and Dubh Loki (a Black IPA previously named "Loki") are currently going through the listing process with ANBL. Batches are standing by, and will likely be pouring at [The Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) and [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/) very soon.

• [The Halifax Cycling Coalition](http://cyclehalifax.ca/) is hosting an event at [Bridge Brewing](http://bridgebeer.ca/) after the [Switch Open Streets](http://switchhfx.ca/) event. Running from 2:30-6:00 this Sunday, there will be live music, food from the [Food Wolf](http://www.thefoodwolf.com/), and pints of Bridge Brewing available. No admission to enjoy the music, and the food and beer is cash-only. Hopefully the skies stay clear for the event.

• Don't forget the [PEI Beer Festival](http://beerfestpei.ca/) is this weekend, starting this evening at 6pm at the New Charlottetown Event Grounds. A detailed post on the festival can be found [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/pei-beerfest-2013/); [tickets](https://www.elevate.com/boxoffice/?cref=80abcccf-9a37-4147-96c2-ba892f1c0a90) are still available, so don't wait any longer to get yours! With over 75 beers available, as well as lots of food pairings and live music, it should be a great time. Head on over to [The PEI Beer Guy](http://www.peibeerguy.com/2013/09/2013-pei-beer-festival-what-to-do.html), who has put together some solid suggestions on what to seek out at the festival.

• [Last week](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/friday-wrap-up-20130830/) we mentioned that [Picaroons](https://www.facebook.com/picaroons) was planning on releasing their annual Harvest Ale, where there will be several versions of the same base beer, with differing hop varieties and local hop fields used. Details are still slim, however we DO know that their official launch for the beer will be Thursday, Sept. 26th at the York St. [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/) in Fredericton. Stay tuned for more info as it becomes available.

• Speaking of Picaroons, they plan on being involved with one of the music events planned for next week's [Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival](http://www.harvestjazzandblues.com/) in Fredericton. On Saturday, Sept. 14th, they will be showcasing "Bluegrass, Blues & BBQ" at the Capital Complex, which will feature southern-style BBQ, as well as live music from [The Modern Grass Quartet](http://themoderngrassquartet.bandcamp.com/) and [Sissy & The Hobos](http://sissyandthehobos.bandcamp.com/). At the Wilser's Room bar, there will be several Picaroons beers on tap, with the possibility of one or two special releases, according to Marketing Director Dennis Goodwin. The show starts at 1 pm (doors open at noon), and the $15 admission will get you a plate of BBQ and access to the all-day live music.

• The [Hart & Thistle](http://www.hartandthistle.com/) have their newest seasonal now on tap, [TubberRoe Robust Porter](http://hartandthistle.blogspot.ca/2013/09/tubberroe-robust-porter.html). Weighing in at 5.9% ABV and 43 IBUs, this beer is full of roast, dark fruit and chocolate notes from the specialty malt used, and plenty of citrus from the Centennial, Cascade, and Falconer's Flight hops.

• Last weekend, [BarNone Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/BarNone.Brewing) in PEI brewed up their first IPA since they started officially selling their beer in July. Showcasing a device called the "Hop Dam" developed by [DME](http://www.dmeinternational.com/) for BarNone, the beer is "heavily dry-hopped" according to BarNone's [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/BARNONEBEER), although we're currently unsure which hop varieties were used. We'll be sure to let you know more about this beer when we can; keep your eyes open for updates on when it will be released!

• By the way, if you're in PEI and are looking to try some BarNone beers on tap, they've added another account to their list - [The Old Triangle](http://www.oldtrianglecharlottetown.com/welcome/) in Charlottetown is now selling their Summer Sessions Ale. Both of BarNone's beers (Summer Sessions and Pale Ale) are still available at [Cedar's and Baba's](http://www.cedarseatery.com/) in Charlottetown, and at [The Landing Oyster House & Pub](http://thelandingpei.com/) in Tyne Valley.

• [reLiSH Gourmet Burgers](http://relishyou.ca/) has become quite popular in Fredericton since they opened several years ago, and have even started other franchises in other areas of New Brunswick, and also in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. This fall, they plan on opening a new type of restaurant in Fredericton, which will pair craft beer with gourmet hamburgers. With a goal of having 6-8 craft beers on tap, as well as in bottles, they plan on opening this restaurant by late October. We'll have more details and a standalone post on this soon!
