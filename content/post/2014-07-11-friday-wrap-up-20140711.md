Happy Friday loyal Beer Readers! Grab a pint and take a few minutes to get caught up on all the Beer News that's fit to print.

• [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) has a new beer in the works. Owner/brewer Shane Steeves confirmed that he just brewed a [California Common](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style07.php#1b) (aka Steam beer) as a tribute to his father, who recently passed away. Brewed in the classic style using a San Francisco Lager yeast, yet fermented at a warmer, closer-to-Ale temperatures, the goal is to have an "easy-drinking beer with bready and toasty notes, along with some fruitiness". Hopped entirely with **Northern Brewer** (a "woodsy"-type hop), the beer will be named _Gammie_, which is what Shane's father was called by his grandchildren. We'll keep you updated on the progress of this beer; we'd also like to express our deepest condolences to Shane and his family.

• Late last week, [Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/) announced that they have officially begun selling their beer! They [posted on their blog](http://petitsault.com/en/blog/28-tante-blanche-a-le-gout-de-sortir) that their Witbier, _Tante Blanche_, is now available on tap at the following locations in Edmundston: [Fraser-Edmundston Golf Club](http://www.golfedmundston.com/), [Station 127](http://www.station127.com/en/), [Frank's Bar & Grill](http://franksgrill.ca/), [Resto-Bar le Deck](http://tourismedmundston.com/en/oumanger.php?item=Resto-Bar+le+Deck&itemnum=22), as well as the [Hotel Victoria](http://www.saintquentin.nb.ca/en/tourism/accommodations-and-restaurants) in Saint-Quentin. The beer should follow shortly in bottles; look for it in Edmundston and Grand Falls ANBL stores by July 14th, and hopefully further across the province in the near future. _Tante Blanche_ will also be pouring tomorrow at the [Brewer's Bash](http://www.brewersbash.picaroons.ca/) in Fredericton!

• Speaking of the Brewer's Bash, it looks like they're a little short on volunteers, so if you don't have a ticket, this is your final chance to attend the sold-out festival! Four hours of volunteer work will get you into the festival, AND access to a special volunteer party at a later date; send them an [email](mailto:volunteer<at>picaroons.ca) if you're interested.

• [Big Tide Brewing](http://www.bigtidebrew.com/) has recently released their very popular summer seasonal, _Karnival_ Kolsch. This [hybrid German style](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style06.php#1c)_ _ is easy drinking, and perfect for the patio weather we've been enjoying recently. The beer was brewed using  Pilsner, acidulated and Munich malts to 4.5% ABV and hopped exclusively with **Saaz** to 50 IBUs. Brewster Wendy Papadopoulos tells us, "I  brewed it because my brother in law, who has spent a fair bit of time in Cologne, Germany, had been asking forever for me to brew a Kolsch". This hybrid style, specific to Cologne, uses an ale yeast, but is fermented fairly cold, and is usually lagered for at least a month. This week also saw the end of the [_Tin Can Porter_](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/friday-wrap-up-6/), and the return of the [_Hemp Pale Ale_](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/friday-wrap-up-20140523/) at Big Tide.

• [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) has released details for their July Beer Dinner, to be held July 29th at 6pm. Here it is, and it looks like there will be two new beers poured at the event, a _Belgian IPA_ (being released next week) and _London-style Porter_. Appetizer: Beer Battered Halibut Cheeks (with Citrus Aioli & Micro Fruits), paired with the _Belgian IPA_. Main course: Beer Braised Lamb Shepherd's Pie, paired with the _Porter_. Dessert: Poached Pear with Vanilla Ice Cream (with Beer Caramel Sauce), paired with _Bigwater Brown_. Tickets are $35 and available at the bar, or by calling 902-423-2938. Brewmaster [Greg Nash](https://twitter.com/__NASH__) at Rockbottom has also been showing off the progress of round two of [_Thulsa Doom_](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2014/04/thulsa-doom-dipa.html), the very popular Double IPA brewed using Conan yeast (stepped up by a [Brewnosers](http://brewnosers.org/) member from a single can of [The Alchemist's](http://alchemistbeer.com/) _Heady Topper_)

• [Propeller Brewery](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has announced the return of their very popular [Prop'r Cask Nights](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/content/Cask_Night) August 15th, after a winter hiatus. Coinciding with the Local Connections Halifax [2014 Sausage Fest](http://localconnections.ca/events/view/408/sausage-fest-2014), Ludo Eveno of [Agricola Street Brasserie](http://agricolastreet.ca/) will be in charge of the sausage-themed feast to pair with the beer. As always, a special cask will be tapped for the evening, and attendees will be able to sample it, as well as Propeller's standard lineup. Limited tickets are [available online](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/propr-cask-night-ft-agricola-st-brasserie-tickets-12180312643) now, and include a commemorative Sausage Fest glass to keep.

• Speaking of Propeller, both they and [Boxing Rock Brewery](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) celebrated anniversaries on Monday, July 7th. Propeller turned 17, and Boxing Rock celebrated their first year of business. Congratulations to both on these great milestones!
