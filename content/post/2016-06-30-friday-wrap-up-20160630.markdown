Hello, and welcome to an early edition of our weekly Friday Wrap-Up! Tomorrow is Canada Day, so we wanted to be sure to catch all of you - and keep you updated on beer info - before the long weekend hits and the beer-enjoying begins!

• Earlier this week, [Gahan Halifax](http://halifax.gahan.ca/) released _Berliner Weisse_, named after the iconic German style known for being lightly sour, refreshing, and easy-drinking. Brewed with a grist of 60% Pilsner malt and 40% Wheat malt, a sour mash was performed to give a light acidity. During the boil, there was a small hop addition of **Magnum** for a low bitterness (5 IBUs), as befits the style. Described by the brewery as "slightly hazy with a thick white head that dissipates quite quickly", it exhibits "lemony, citrus notes" to go along with the tartness from the sour mash. In addition, they've made a raspberry simple syrup that can be added to the beer (a practice still in use in Berlin today), for those who prefer to cut the acidity a tad. A supremely sessionable 4% ABV, it's a perfect style for drinking during the summer! Look for more summer-themed seasonals coming soon, all of which are fermented with either their house American yeast strain, or a German Hefeweizen strain. Speaking of which, their summer Beer Bar (extra patio location) is now open, where all Gahan core brands and two Halifax seasonals are available on tap, as well as a limited food menu. As its opening is weather-dependent, be sure to check their social media for the latest news.

• [Flying Boats](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710) will be releasing a new beer over the long weekend, their first Session IPA. Hopped entirely with **Galaxy** - a delicious Australian variety with characteristics of passionfruit and citrus - it comes in at an easy-drinking 4.7% ABV, and 44 IBUs. Currently unnamed, it will be on tap this weekend at [Marky's Laundromat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2429282830/), and sometime next week at the [Tide & Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) and [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/The-James-Joyce-Pub-187205728006725/?fref=ts).

• [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) is continuing with the interesting beer releases, this time with _Wiley Boys_, a Black Saison aged on currants that will be released tomorrow. Brewed with Pilsner, Munich, Chocolate, and Black malts, it was lightly-hopped with **Galena** and **Willamette** to 20 IBUs. Clocking in at 6% ABV, this one will first be available at North retail locations for growler fills, and on tap at [Battery Park](http://batterypark.ca/), until next week's release to a few other lucky tap accounts in the HRM. The beer will be launched as North takes over the Battery Park patio at 11:30AM tomorrow, also pouring a pair of special casks of their [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) collaboration _Gose_, one batch aged on barberries, the other on mango, as well as blasts from the past _Sauer Sagen Hat_ Sour and _Belgian Milk Stout_.

• The [Big Tide](https://www.facebook.com/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co-301456876447/) / [Boiling Point Podcast](https://www.facebook.com/boilingpointpodcast/) beer that we originally reported on [last month](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/05/20/friday-wrap-up-20160520/) is now on tap at the brewpub, and we have all the details. Brewed to celebrate the 100th episode of the podcast that stars Greg Hemmings and Dave Veale, Brewmaster Wendy Papadopoulos was charged by the voting public to brew a beer that was "golden, citrusy, sweet, potent, local, spicy, and sessionable"... not exactly an easy task! Not one to fail to rise to the challenge, however, Wendy settled on a Honey Ginger Ale, named _Hemmingsway Vealey Great Ale_. Brewed with Pale Ale and Wheat malts, and hopped with all NB-grown varieties (**EKG** from Southan Farms, and **Cascade** and **Hallertau** from Darlings Island Farm), fresh ginger was also added during the mash, boil, and fermentation. Lemon rind, lemongrass, and honey were all added to the boil as well, resulting in a 7.5% ABV, 38 IBUs beer. And good news for those of you attending next week's [Tasting NB](https://www.facebook.com/events/1745077322415797/) in Fredericton - this one may just pop up at the event on Saturday!

• Also last month, [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) put a call out for all patrons to bring in as much rhubarb as they could, to be used for a special beer, and to be exchanged for brewery credit. That beer - _It's Rhubarb Saison!_ - is now available as of today. A "refreshing wheat beer brewed in the Saison style", over 500 lbs of fresh, local rhubarb were added to give a "clean, tart character" to the pale, hazy-orange brew. Available on tap only at the brewery for tasters and growler fills, it comes in at 5.7% ABV.

• Garrison has also released their ACBA Gold-medal-winning _Rise n' Stein_ Hefeweizen today. This 5.5% ABV classic German style features a significant amount of wheat in the malt bill, and is fermented using a traditional Hefe yeast for notes of clove and banana on the hazy beer with a pillowy white head. The beer is available at the brewery now on tap and in bottles, with bottles also at the private stores, and hitting NSLC shelves in a couple of weeks. The beer was first brewed in celebration of the [Halifax Oktoberfest](http://hfxoktoberfest.com/), with this year's event taking place Sept 16 & 17, 2016. September 17th also marks the first time the [Canada Beer Run](http://www.canadabeerrun.com/products/halifax-beer-run) will hit Halifax. The 11.4 km run starts at Garrison, and features a route that will take racers to Good Robot and Propeller Brewing for bevvies, as well as a "satellite" set up from Spindrift. The run finishes back at Garrison, to take part in the Oktoberfest-ivities.

• [Big Spruce](http://www.bigspruce.ca/)'s "Wheat IPA", _You Spin me White Round_, is back for the season. Originally brewed "in conspiracy" with Sawdust City Brewing (Gravenhurst, ON) in February, 2014, it features plenty of malted organic Wheat in a "traditional American-style IPA" grist. First-wort hopped with Magnum, with later additions of Chinook and Amarillo for plenty of citrusy, grapefruit aromas and flavours, it weighs in at 6.5% ABV.

• Halifax's [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) has brought back their popular David Lynch-inspired beer, _Damn Fine Coffee & Cherry Pie_ Pale Ale. While light amber in colour (thanks to a Pilsner base with Rye and Red X malts), the beer evokes thoughts of something darker, thanks to the generous addition of cold-brewed [Java Blend](http://javablendcoffee.com/) Ethiopian Guji coffee. The use of **Cascade** and **Falconer's Flight **hops (to 40 IBUs) and California Ale yeast lends a fruit and berry aroma to round out the beer. The 5.1% ABV beer is on tap at the brewery for pints and growler fills, and will be in the wild shortly.

• We have a bit more info on the [Grimross](http://grimross.com/) expansion we briefly mentioned last week. They have taken over an additional 4000 sq. ft. of space adjacent to the brewery/taproom, doubling their area to a total of 8000 sq. ft. As they continue to add fermentors to allow them to brew more beer, as well as hosting more events in their taproom, the extra space will be a welcome addition to the brewery. Phase one, the expansion of the taproom and warehouse space, is currently underway, with phase two occurring in the near future, which will result in a greater fermentation capacity, addition of a canning ling, as well as an outdoor patio "overlooking a very scenic marshland".

• As we mentioned last week, [Mill Street Brewpub](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) in St. John's has released their second beer, _Capelin Hound_ Session IPA. The 4.0% ABV beer features loads of **Cascade** and **Mosaic** in the dry-hop to complement the 50 IBUs. Featuring a melon and citrus aroma, with fruit flavour and a light lingering bitterness that keeps you coming back for the next sip. The low ABV is perfect for those who want to enjoy a few while waiting for the [Capelin to roll](https://newfoundsander.wordpress.com/capelin/).

• The [Murphy Hospitality Group](http://mhgpei.com/) has confirmed in a recent story by [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/News/Local/2016-06-29/article-4574830/Murphy-Group-opening-new-hotel-in-Moncton/1) that they will be opening a new hotel in downtown Moncton, The Wesley Hotel, in late 2017/early 2018 on the corner of Wesley and Queen streets. In addition, the hotel will house another location for the Gahan House Restaurant and Brewery, making it the third brewpub for the company, joining its sister properties in Charlottetown and Halifax. Featuring a 6 bbl (700 litre) [DME](http://www.dmebrewing.ca/) brewhouse, the brewpub will have indoor seating for 160 patrons, plus an additional 60-seat seasonal patio. We'll be sure to update with more information as the brewery nears completion.

• For our homebrewing/small commercial brewery readers in the Saint John region, a new brewing store is opening today to meet your expanding needs. The [NB Craft Brewers Market](https://www.facebook.com/nbcbm/) is located in Rothesay, and will be carrying grain, hops, and yeast from White Labs. Owner Michael Hebert is very open to bringing in ingredients for the local community, so be sure to reach out to put in your requests. While not a brick and mortar shop, the [online store](http://nbcbm.ca/) will be launching this afternoon at 6, and orders are available for pickup within a couple of hours of submission.

• The [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/) released their [annual report](http://www.mynslc.com/Documents/News%20Releases/2016/Final%202015-2016%20year%20end%20News%20Release%20final%20(002).pdf) this week, and local beer sales continue to show excellent growth. Small Nova Scotian breweries' sales rose by more than 25% to $7.6M, significantly outpacing the overall beer growth of 2.1%. The news is heartening, but small local producers still account for just 4% of the NS beer market, indicating that there is lots of room for continued growth in the years to come. Any worry that the market for small and locally-owned breweries is becoming saturated seems unfounded given these numbers. What is frustrating is that by the NSLC's own report, there are just "more than 40" listings of NS craft beer at NSLC stores, where most packaged product is sold. Improving the number to capture the dozens more styles and offerings from around the province would see local product continue to increase, employing more in the province.

With tomorrow's holiday a great excuse to grab a local beer, we reached out to the breweries in our region to see what they have planned. We didn't hear from everyone, so be sure to check social media for their hours of operation:
