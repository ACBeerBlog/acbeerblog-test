Happy Friday! Plenty going on in the local beer world this week, so let's dive right in...

• [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/) has released their collaboration with [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301)'s Patrice Godin, a Doppelbock named _La Renous_. Brewed in the traditional German style, using German hops and a base of Munich and 2-Row malts and a touch of chocolate malt for colouring. Lagered for a full four months since the brew on a chilly January weekend, it is supremely drinkable, with a full mouthfeel and balancing bitterness to its 7.5% ABV content. In addition to Petit-Sault's shop, it is available on tap at Le Coude, [Université de Moncton's](http://www.umoncton.ca/) student bar, where Acadie-Broue's brewhouse is now set up. The beer can also be found at [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Products?Search=Petit-Sault&Type=Store&NewProductsOnly=false&OrderBy=ProductName&OrderAscending=true&Take=25&Skip=0&ProductClassSelected=&ProductLineSelected=&StoreSelected=&SugarLevelSelected=&VintageSelected=&ShowStores=&ShowSugarLevels=&ShowVintages=&ViewCategorySelected=&GrapeVarietySelected=&ShowGrapeVarieties=&Printable=) locations across the province, in bottles, and at the five [ANBL growler](http://www.nbliquor.com/documents/growler.pdf) stations this weekend.

• Just in time for this week's [East Coast Music Week](http://www.ecma.com/), Sydney's [Breton Brewing](http://bretonbrewing.ca/) and Charlottetown's [Upstreet](http://upstreetcraftbrewing.com) have released a collaboration brew, _Island Jams: Vol. 1_. This music-themed 5.3% Blonde ale debuted at Breton's tasting room last night, and will see wider release this weekend. Also tying in with the music theme, there is a [downloadable EP](http://www.bit.do/islandjams) of CB- and PE- Island tunes to accompany your drinking. As well, a live showcase of PEI bands will be playing (and beer will be flowing) at Daniel's in Sydney tonight; [more information here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1111487982216674/). And for visitors to the East Coast Music Week, all four Breton beers will be available at [Flavor on the Water's](http://www.sydneyport.ca/joan-harriss-cruise-pavilion/flavor-on-the-water/) after parties all weekend.

• Upstreet has brewed up another collab, _Top Stamp_ Honey Brown Lager, with the crew from the PEI comedy series [Just Passing Through](http://www.justpassingthrough.ca/). An easy-drinking beer at 5% ABV and 15 IBUs, it was brewed with Maritime Malt and New Brunswick-grown **Golding** hops. A beer that has a sweet beginning and dry finish, it's like "drizzling honey over lightly-browned toast", according to the brewery. Scheduled for a release party on Thursday, April 21st at the Upstreet taproom beginning at 6:30, the beer will be bottled and sold at PEILCC locations across the Island by next weekend. Check out the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1780450995520690/) for more details on next week's launch events.

• There's a new beer fermenting over at [Maybee Brewing](http://www.maybeebrew.com/), _Birdseye Pale Ale_. A 5.5% ABV American Pale Ale, it was hopped with **Cluster** and **Columbus**. Brewed with the intention of being crisp and refreshing for the upcoming summer months, it features floral and spicy notes from the Cluster, which "brightens up the dank, juicy flavours from the Columbus", according to owner/brewer Paul Maybee. Look for this one to be available in a couple of weeks; it's going to be canned right out of the gate, and will also be available for growler fills at the brewery. Also, Maybee's _Elevensies Espresso Stout_ should be available in cans shortly.

• [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/) has just released their newest beer, _Golden Stout_. Golden-coloured as advertised, it was brewed with 2-row, flaked oats, and Pale Chocolate malt. Despite the lack of dark, roasted malts, it features plenty of chocolate and roasted character thanks to the addition of Sumatran Dark from local [Java Blend Coffee Roasters](http://javablendcoffee.com/), and cocoa nibs from [Rousseau Chocolatier](http://rousseauchocolatier.ca/). It weighs in at 6.7% ABV and is available now at the brewery for growler fills, and should be on tap at North accounts as we speak.

• [Gahan Halifax](http://halifax.gahan.ca/) released a new beer yesterday at the brewpub; _Session IPA_ is a low-alcohol (3.7% ABV), 65 IBUs hop bomb that showcases a "big floral, fruity aroma" from plenty of late-addition **Saphir** hops. It joins the _Kellerbier_ which was tapped late last week; weighing in at 5% ABV and 36 IBUs, featuring an "oaky, vanilla aroma and flavour", balanced with a large addition of **Hersbrucker** hops, a floral and spicy German variety. And though there is just a little bit of their _Cranberry Sour_ left, fear not, this sour-mashed tart beer will return during [NS Craft Beer Week](http://nscraftbeer.ca/) with wider distribution under the name _Over the Top_, a collaboration between Gahan's Karen Allen and Boxing Rock's Emily Tipton.

• In other new beer news, [Tatamagouche](http://tatabrew.com/) released their newest ale yesterday, _Tweed Wolf Brown IPA_. This is their second "employee beer", brewed by cellarman Alex Martin. Featuring a malty backbone and "chocolate-covered strawberries" in the flavour, it was hopped mainly with **Simcoe**, along with a bit of **Cascade** and **Huell Melon**. Available now at the brewery for growlers, kegs have already been delivered to several accounts in Halifax, including [Bishop's Cellar](http://bishopscellar.com/) and [Harvest Wines](http://www.harvestwines.ca/store/) for growler fills, so be sure to give it a try when it pops up! And while on the topic of Tatabrew cellar hands, they're currently looking for someone to fill the role in a part-time capacity, with the possibility of a full-time position in the future. For more details, [send an email here](mailto:mkenny@tatabrew.com).

• Wolfville's [Annapolis Cider Company](http://drinkannapolis.ca) officially opens today! Their storefront at [388 Main Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/388+Main+St,+Wolfville,+NS+B4P+1C9,+Canada/@45.091903,-64.3624527,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4b5855a0d57f8eff:0x432b58ffc072160a) will be open seven days a week from 10 am-7 pm. There are several ciders available now in refillable 750 mL bottles at the cidery: _Crisp & Dry_ (7.7% ABV), _Juicy & Sweet_ (5.6% ABV), and _Something Different_, an unfiltered cider that is described as "very hazy and yeasty"; it comes in at 6% ABV. There is a tasting bar onsite, where customers can order a small flight of all three ciders, 3 oz each, for $5. Tours will be offered in the near future, and their products should be popping up on tap at various accounts within the next couple of months. For more information on this new cidery, check out [our post from last month](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/03/18/friday-wrap-up-20160318/).

• [Liquid Assets](https://www.facebook.com/LiquidAssetsNS), the Nova Scotian beer, wine, and spirits store located at the [Halifax Stanfield International Airport](http://hiaa.ca/), will be opening this Monday, April 18th. Located at the departures level of the HIAA, they will be selling products from eight craft breweries to start: Bad Apple, Boxing Rock, Garrison, Nine Locks, North, Propeller, Spindrift, and Tatamagouche. They will be selling cans in 4- and 6-packs, and single 500 mL and 650 mL bottles. As they are located past the security checkpoint, you can carry your purchases with you on your flight (provided you do not have to go through security again); they will have boxes for multiple purchases. The store will be open 7am-9pm, daily, and will be launching an online store in the near future, so that customers may pre-order beers for a quick pick-up, and plans for shipping of products within Canada are in the works.

• This weekend's [Saint John Beerfest](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest) may be sold out, but several breweries are releasing special brews in celebration of the event, and will be making them available to a wider audience. Among them, [Big Tide Brewpub](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Tide-Brewing-Co/301456876447) has released a Hard Root Beer, _Tool Shed Root Porter_. Brewed with 2-row, CaraMunich, and Chocolate Wheat malt, it was bittered lightly with [Southan Farms](http://www.southanfarms.net/) hop hash. Freshly-cut white birch bark was added to the boil, along with sassafras, sarsaparilla, vanilla beans and sweet gale. It should come in at ~6.3% ABV, and will be released tomorrow at the Beer Fest (joining their _Karnival Kolsch_ and _Valley View_ Farmhouse Ale), and on tap at the brewpub.

Lots of events coming up, as usual...

• Other events accompanying this weekend's Saint John Beerfest are several pop-ups and events around the area **today**:

Concentrating on the market at first, they will expand their beers to local bars and restaurants, and open their storefront. Speaking of beers, they have announced one of their launch beers, _Gut View Amber Ale_. A 4.9% English Amber, it features Canadian-grown English varietal hops for a balancing bitterness, and subtle aromas.

Have a great weekend! Just a few closing notes...

- [Boxing Rock](http://www.boxingrock.ca/) has brought back their popular _Sessionista_ "Bold Session Ale", a beer with the big hop character of an IPA, in a small 4.0% ABV package. It is available province-wide in the [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/Pages/ProductAvailability.aspx?ProductId=1020559) now, and on tap at various beer bars as well.

The brewery's _4 Alarm IPA_ and various seasonals will be featured.
- [Spindrift](http://spindriftbrewing.com/) is releasing their _Riptide IPL_ in cans early next week; as a result, there will be no 7th Wave Series release today. However, look for the _Riptide_ cans to be available at the brewery by no later than next Friday.
- [Propeller Brewing](http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/) has released their wildly popular _Hefeweizen_ this week, and it is available in bottles for the first time in a while.

- There have been no major updates in [last week's story](http://acbeerblog.ca/2016/04/08/friday-wrap-up-20160408/) concerning policy changes for breweries in New Brunswick by ANBL; they are still communicating with [NBCAPA](https://www.facebook.com/nbcapa). We will be sure to provide an update once one is announced.
