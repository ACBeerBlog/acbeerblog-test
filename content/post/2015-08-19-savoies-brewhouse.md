[Savoie's Brewhouse](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Savoies-Brewhouse/1617785005132093) has recently opened in Charlo River, in Northeast New Brunswick. Owner and brewer Rodney Savoie was kind enough to answer a few of our questions regarding his new venture.

**
ACBB: How did you get into the world of craft beer?
**Rodney: I have only been into craft beer for about 4 to 5 years now, and that is approximately how long I have been brewing. A HUGE thanks goes to Derek Leslie from [Shiretown Beer](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/) who had piqued my interest, but also has been like a mentor and guide for me in this endeavour!

**What made you decide to take the step into brewing professionally?
**I always wanted to get into business. I first looked into micro distilling, but as time went on, I started home brewing and enjoyed the beer that was being made. Others have as well, so that is why I decided to move towards the beer business.

**
What size/manufacturer/type of system are you be brewing on?
**I am using a 75 litre electric brewhouse, with a control panel from [High Gravity Brew](http://www.highgravitybrew.com/store/pc/Electric-Brewing-Systems-e68.htm), and hot liquor tank, mash tun and kettle from [Ontario Beer Kegs](http://www.ontariobeerkegs.com/).

**Can you tell us about the beers you are offering initially?
**I started with an Amber beer which now is called _Chaleur Phantom Amber Ale_. Not long after, the Blonde Ale was created, _Island Lake Blonde_. Both are lightly hopped beers. The next beer is going to be a Rye IPA called _Charlo Falls IPA_, named after a well known local swimming spot, and a [popular spot for photographers](https://www.google.com/search?q=Charlo+Falls&es_sm=93&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CB4QsARqFQoTCP3lyN7bo8cCFUWZiAod-X4EwQ&biw=1777&bih=836&dpr=0.9).

**
What are your plans for distribution? Plans for tap accounts, bottles, growlers, etc.?
**I am starting with bottles in the [ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/Products?OrderAscending=true&Take=25&Skip=0&Search=Savoies+Brewhouse) locations near Charlo, including Bathurst, Campbellton, Dalhousie, and Tracadie-Sheila. We will be supplying the [James Joyce Pub in Fredericton](https://www.facebook.com/FoodatTheCrownDowntown) with kegs when possible, and will be on tap at the [Heron's Nest Pub](https://www.facebook.com/HeronsNestPub) in Charlo very soon. Due to the small volume, we don't plan on offering growlers for the time being.

**
Do you have a favorite beer style, beer, or brewery you enjoy drinking?**
As of right now my favorite beer would be an Amber beer with mild to medium hop bitterness. I also enjoy an IPA from time to time.

**What are your plans for the future?**
There are no real plans: we are just going to brew, fill orders as best as we can, and see where this will take us.
