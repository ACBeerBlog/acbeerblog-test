Good morning, and welcome to another Friday! As usual, there's plenty of beer news to share for the week, so let's not waste any time with preamble. Ok, truth is the site was down for awhile and we lost a lot of changes, including a witty intro, and I just don't have it in me to try to come up with it again!

• Let's kick off the week with the announcement of a new brewery on Nova Scotia's South Shore. [Heritage Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/HeritageBrewingCo/) is opening their doors for the first time **tomorrow**, at [19 Kirk St in Yarmouth](https://goo.gl/maps/Z2PY4rLsL132). From 11-3, they will be pouring their four beer for sampling onsite, and in growlers to take away. They will be pouring their Amber Ale, Blonde Ale, Session IPA and/or Stout all day (or until they run out!). Merchandise, including clothing and glassware will also be available for purchase. Look for a full Profile with the Heritage crew Monday morning. Congratulations on your opening!

• Moncton's [Bore City](http://www.borecitybrewing.com/) is back on the board with a couple of new beers! First up is the recently-released _Jus de Citra_, which has been on tap at [Marky's Laundromat](https://plus.google.com/109859429604647630387/about?gl=ca&hl=en) for a couple of days and is going fast. This American IPA is hopped entirely with, you guessed it, the beautiful **Citra** variety. A simple grist of Pilsner and 2-row malt, along with a healthy amount of Flaked Oats to boost the body, lets the tropical juiciness of one of our favourite hops shine through. Fermented with Conan to boost that juicy character even further, it weights in at 6.5% ABV and 68 IBUs. If it's out at the Laundromat by the time you read this, fear not... you can always make the trek to Fredericton's [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/theJamesJoycePubFredericton/), where it should be available on tap any time now.

• The other new beer from Bore City has been brewed and is just finishing up fermentation. Accordingly named _Koalatee Pale Ale_, this one was hopped with three Australian varieties: **Ella**, **Summer**, and **Vic Secret**. Expect plenty of citrus and tropical fruit in this brew as well; it should clock in around 5.5% ABV, and will be available within the next few weeks. As always, we'll keep you updated!

• Now that there's finally some inklings of nice weather in our area, those of you in Fredericton have a good excuse to head over to [TrailWay Brewing](http://www.trailwaybrewing.com/) to check out their new-and-improved patio. Luckily, they've also released a brand new beer to give you yet another excuse! _Blueprint_ is the brewery's latest Porter, described by the brewery as "chocolate-forward, sessionable, dry and crisp". A popular style in the taproom (where you can pick up growlers, pints, and cans), this **5% ABV** brew will also be available on tap around the city.

• Sticking around Fredericton, [Half Cut Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/HalfCutBrewing) has their first new beer in a while out and about the city. _Tickle Fight IPA_ is a 5.8% ABV American IPA hopped with **Warrior** and **Sorachi Ace**, giving an "ample amount of bitterness, with lots of fruit character, including citrus, mango, and passionfruit", according to the brewery. Look for it on tap at your favourite Half Cut tap account today.

• In cider news in the city, [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) has their first cask-conditioned release on at the Cider House as of this week. _Paradise_ is a 7% ABV dry cider with a "sweet aroma of pineapple and a dry apple finish"; available only for glasses served in-house at the downtown location, be sure to drop in and try this limited released while it's still available!

• You may have noticed an announcement from [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/) about a new beer of theirs, _La Madoueska_, which they're referring to as an "Acadien Brown Ale". Brewed with a combination of "Pale, Caramelized, and Toasted malts", it has an aroma of freshly-ground coffee beans and dark chocolate, accompanied by a fairly dry finish. There will be an announcement [later today](https://www.facebook.com/events/1763132993992838/)  by Sebastien Roy of [Fils du Roy](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/) regarding this new "style"; you'll likely be seeing several beers brewed in this way from Acadien breweries in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the 6% ABV _La Madoueska_ is available on tap at the Petit-Sault taproom for pints, bottles and growlers, at ANBL growler stations this weekend, and in bottles at select ANBL stores.

• [Good Robot](http://goodrobotbrewing.ca) is bringing back last year's _The Shocking Pink_, a Gose-Radler hybrid of sorts that they originally introduced for the 2016 [OUTeast Film Festival](http://www.outeastfilm.com/) in Halifax. Well, the festival returns on June 15th, and so does version 2.0 of the beer! This hazy, straw-coloured beer is the brewery's Goseface Killah with pink lemonade added, as well as organic teas "Queen of Tarts" and "Fruity Oasis" from [DAVIDsTEA](https://www.davidstea.com/ca_en/). Tart, salty, lemony, and fruity, v 2.0 will be launched on the 15th when the festival opens; look for it on tap across the city.

• Wolfville's [Annapolis Cider](http://drinkannapolis.ca/) has released the latest in their **Heritage Series**, _Old-Fashioned Gravenstein_. Using only hand-picked, local Gravs, they crafted a 7.4% ABV cider with a fresh apple aroma and crisp, tart, flavour. This release is available exclusively at the cidery on Main Street.

• [Mill Street St John's](http://millstreetbrewery.com/stjohns-brew-pub/) has released a new beer, taking inspiration from Italy. _Terrazza Lager_ clocks in at 4.8% ABV and 30 IBUs, featuring biscuit and bread notes, with a spicy hop character from **Saaz **hops. Grab a pint or growler at the bar today, and at [EVOO in the Courtyard](https://www.facebook.com/evoointhecy/), at Water and Beck's Cove.

• Digby's[ Roof Hound Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/roofhound/) is putting the finishing touches on a brand new beer set to mid-next-week. _Thyme to Grow a Pear Blueberry Kettle Sour _is a complex and flavourful beer that will be hitting their taps, as well as licensees shortly. Featuring a light base from Pilsner and Wheat malts, the beer was soured in the kettle thanks to a healthy dose of yogourt (which contains the necessary _Lactobacillus _bacteria). After a couple of days letting those guys do their work, the beer is boiled to kill them off, at which point Pear puree was added. After further fermentation with a traditional yeast, Blueberry puree made its appearance in the beer. And while the beer finished its conditioning and carbonation, fresh Thyme was added to the brite tank. All of this culminates in a 3.9% ABV acidic, yet clean, beer, with a lovely thyme and fruit finish.

• You may have spotted a new publication in Nova Scotia breweries this week, the **NS Beer Guide**. Published independently from any brewery or organization, it aims to put the information for all Nova Scotia breweries together in one book for easy reference. Follow along on their [social](https://twitter.com/nsbeerguide) [media](https://www.instagram.com/nsbeerguide/) pages to see where the guides have been delivered to grab yours over the next few days, as they visit all of the breweries in the province.

• On the Isthmus of Chignecto (try saying that after a couple beers), [Trider’s](http://www.triderscraftbeer.ca/) in Amherst has a new beer in bottles. _My Honey, My Heather_ is the result of experimentation that followed after a local honey producer approached Trider’s and asked if they wanted to do a honey beer. The beer uses a few buckets of wild honey and the team is pretty happy with the result; it also contains heather, hence the name. Meanwhile, if you’re in Halifax and you’re wondering where you might find Trider’s brews on tap, we’ve got the scoop: The Local on Gottingen has had _White Ogre_ and _Rod’s Red_, The Stubborn Goat will be serving _Rod’s Red_ as well, and the Timber Lounge will have 500 ml bottles of the _Brew-Deau_. More accounts will no doubt follow in coming weeks; we’ll let you know as we’re made aware.

• On the South Shore of NS [Boxing Rock](http://t.co/MSXPNPSfNb) is holding a contest to name their latest beer, this one a Cream Ale brewed specially for the Tall Ships visit to Shelburne on **August 14th and 15th** as part of the [RDV2017](http://www.rdv2017.com/) Guest Port Program in Canada to celebrate [Canada 150](http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1468854891549). Your prospective name needs to be submitted in person at the brewery (open 7 days a week, 11AM - 7PM) between **June 8th** and **July 8th** to qualify. The winner will be revealed at Boxing Rock’s birthday party celebration on July 8th. This isn’t a ballot-box stuffing style contest, it’s all about creativity, and we’ve been assured that “Beery McBeerface” isn’t in the running. We’re told that the beer itself is light and easy-drinking, with a grist comprised of 100% malt. Hopped with both European noble and North American varieties for a light bitterness and mild aroma, it weighs in at 5% ABV.

• Halifax’s [2 Crows](https://www.2crowsbrewing.com/) tapped a new beer yesterday afternoon, a “super tropical” brett pale ale called _Angel Eyes_. Fermented with a blend of Brettanomyces strains, it’s a healthy 6.5% ABV and a solid 34 IBU. Dry hopped with new world hop varietals **Azacca**, **Galaxy**, and **Citra**, expect a juicy and funky presence, with a dry finish and a strong pineapple and lemon notes. Brewmaster **Jeremy Taylor** even gave a shoutout on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/2crowsbrewing/photos/a.1020342961353919.1073741828.1014686715252877/1347729878615224/?type=3) to our own **Shawn Meek** and a similar recipe he concocted a couple of years back (but don’t tell him that, it’ll go right to his head). This is a very limited release, with only 250 litres available on tap at the brewery. And speaking of the brewery, 2 Crows now has a patio with seating for 20 out front on Brunswick Street. We suspect that a pint of _Angel Eyes_ and a seat on the patio might be an excellent squad goal for craft beer lovers in Halifax this weekend! And if Brett isn’t your thing, there’s still some of the 2 Crows x [902 BrewCast](http://www.902brewcast.com/) _In Theory_ to be had.

• You may remember the _Pucker Up Cranberry Hibiscus Wit_ originally launched by [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) back in 2015. They've revamped the beer as a kettle sour, and have re-launched the beer as _Pucker Up_. This bright red beer is brewed with Pilsner and Wheat malt, and was soured with Lactobacillus bacteria, before being briefly boiled (but no hops were added to the brew). It still has the pomegranate and hibiscus notes like the original beer, and comes in at a quaffable 4.7% ABV. The brewery describes the taste as "Fun Dip for adults", which probably gives you a pretty good idea of the flavours! Available at the brewery for tasters and growlers now, look for it to follow at local tap accounts very soon. And in other Garrison news, they're once again putting out calls for locally-grown rhubarb! Bring your fresh, usable rhubarb in to the brewery (leaves removed, please) for a free taster, plus an in-store credit of $1 per pound (limit of 10 lbs per person).

**Another busy weekend ahead of us, folks!**

• Starting **today**, visitors to [Schoolhouse Brewery](http://schoolhousebrewery.ca/)'s new Windsor location will be able to grab a full pint of Schoolhouse's, and guest breweries', beer.  Drop by 40 Water Street today at 3:20PM (when school lets out, off course) until 9PM, or on the weekend from 11AM.

Friday's music leader is Jon Rehder, and will feature plenty of local and visiting musicians throughout the summer.

• For those in the Annapolis Valley (or looking for an excuse to head there), [La Torta Pizzeria](https://www.facebook.com/LaTortaPizzeria/) in Wolfville will be hosting a Tap Takeover by Halifax's 2 Crows Brewing **Saturday** from 3pm. Featuring their core lineup, as well as several one-offs and brand new offerings, be sure to drop by for a slice and flight tomorrow. (If you can't wait to see what's available, checkout [La Torta's IG](https://www.instagram.com/latortapizzeria/)  for the details)

• There are few good reasons to stay close to Moncton's Tide & Boar tomorrow morning: at 10AM they are holding the latest of their [Growler Fill Mornings](https://www.facebook.com/events/312453695854941), when they offer some of their house-brewed beer in a take-away format. This weekend's offerings are _Pow Pillows_ IPA (a New England-style IPA with **Citra**, **Galaxy**, and **Nelson Sauvin** hops, with some lactose for residual sweetness), _Hand Plant_IPA (all **Galaxy**, and a non-flocculating yeast for a hazy outcome), and _Layback Lager_ (brewed with rye, New Zealand hops, and fermented with a German lager yeast). And stick around until 11AM, where you can grab a pour from their single bottle of Sam Adams _Utopias_, the 25%ABV+ beer that drinks more like whisky than a beer. Plus those who do purchase a 1 ounce pour with have a chance to win the [iconic bottle](http://img.wennermedia.com/article-leads-horizontal/mj-618_348_the-200-beer-sam-adams-utopias.jpg).

• Now that the Central City "[Red Racer Across the Nation](http://centralcitybrewing.com/canadian-craft-brewers-unveil-canada150-beers-for-red-racer-across-the-nation-collaboration-12-unique-craft-beers-represent-each-region-of-the-country/)" collaboration twelve-pack can be found in three of the four Atlantic Provinces ([ANBL](http://www.nbliquor.com/Home/ProductDetails/28199), [NLC](http://www.nlliquor.com/products/18510/Red%20Racer%20Across%20the%20Nation%20Collaboration%2012%20Pack), [Bishop's Cellar](https://bishopscellar.com/store/red-racer-across-the-nation-12-pack.html) and [Cristall Wine](http://www.cristallwinemerchants.com/store/) in NS, with [PEILCC](http://liquorpei.com/) to come very soon), the dates and details for the kick-off parties are all set.
