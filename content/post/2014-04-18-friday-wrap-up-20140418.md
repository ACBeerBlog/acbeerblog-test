Happy Friday everyone! We hope you're reading this while sipping a nice coffee stout or citrusy IPA to start your long weekend off right.

• [Lion & Bright](https://www.facebook.com/lionandbright) is hosting a [Spruce up the Planet! Earth Day Celebration](https://www.ecologyaction.ca/earthday) this Tuesday, April 22nd, in support of the [Ecology Action Centre](https://www.ecologyaction.ca/). It will feature a tap takeover by [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.bigspruce.ca/), featuring _Bitter Get'er India Black IPA_,  _The Whole 9 Yards_, _Cereal Killer_, _Kitchen Party_, _Regatta Red_, _You Spin Me White Round White IPA_ will all be on tap, and a cask of _Cereal Killer Sideways_, infused with [Glenmorangie](http://www.glenmorangie.com/our-whiskies/the-original), will also be pouring. Jeremy and the rest of Big Spruce Nation will be in attendance, so drop by and say hello. There are no tickets required for the event, but show up promptly at 6pm to get a packet of seeds to help green up Halifax and to enjoy the music and food. $1/per pint of beer sold goes to the EAC.

• In more Big Spruce news, they kicked off the **Roving Canadian Craft Beer Bag** this week. Born out of receiving the bag with their _Organic Conspiracy_ from Brian and Rebecca at [Crannóg Ales](http://www.crannogales.com/), they want to keep the Canadian Beer Love going! The first recipient will be Aaron Spinney at [Sawdust City](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sawdust-City-Brewery/139064472841673), with a growler of their collaboration _You Spin Me White Round White IPA_ and _The Whole 9 Yards_. We'll be sure to keep an eye on this fantastic new tradition as it criss-crosses the country by bus.

• Finally in Big Spruce news, they recently received the second part of their expanded brewhouse, [two 10 barrel unitanks](https://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing/photos/pb.417791361612572.-2207520000.1397826600./687421874649518/?type=3&theater), allowing them to ferment, condition and carbonate all in one vessel, allowing for an efficient way to make use of their space. As an aside, they are brewing up another batch of their_ White IPA_ today, so all of us fans will have another chances to get our hands on it. For folks lucky enough to be in the area to purchase growlers, they are very short on _The Whole 9 Yards_ First Anniversary Scotch Ale, so be sure to drop by now to avoid disappointment. Like many breweries and the private beer stores, they are open today and Sunday, even if the provincial stores are not.

• Tuesday's [Burgers n' Beer](https://www.facebook.com/events/478530042248445/) in Fredericton was a great success; the sold-out event was a dual effort from the [Fredericton Beer Festival](http://www.frederictoncraftbeerfestival.com/) and [reLiSH Gourmet Burgers](http://relishyou.ca/), and featured six specialty sliders paired with six different craft beers, including first-timers to Fredericton [Celtic Knot](https://www.facebook.com/CelticKnotBrewing) _Dubh Loki Black IPA_ and [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) _Red Coat India Red Ale_. Along with ciders from Red Rover, and more beer from [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307), [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/) and [Central City](http://centralcitybrewing.com/) (_Red Racer IPA_), the quality of all was top-notch! The next event takes place in Moncton at [reLiSH](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Relish+Gourmet+Burgers/@46.088289,-64.778111,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4ca0b93946f01de3:0x5932587aacbca776) on Tuesday, April 29th from 8 pm - 10 pm. The tentative brewery list includes the brand new [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery), Celtic Knot, Grimross, Hammond River, Red Rover, and Shiretown. Tickets ($45, taxes and fees included) can be purchased [here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/burgers-n-beer-moncton-tickets-11249434361?aff=eorg).

• Last Saturday featured the judging of the five finalists for the 1st Annual **Gahan Home Brewer's Challenge**, which took place at the [Gahan House](https://www.facebook.com/TheGahanHouse) in Charlottetown. The winning beer came from the brewing team of Ryan Palmer and Lee Nicholson with their _PEI Cranberry Wit_, a sessionable ale at 4.3% ABV brewed with coriander and orange peel, with cranberries added during secondary fermentation. Ryan and Lee will get to brew a full-sized batch of their beer on the Gahan system with brewmaster Trent Hayes, to be served on tap at the Gahan House in a couple of weeks. Congratulations, Ryan and Lee!

• [Rogues Roost Brewpub](http://www.roguesroost.ca/) now has their _Oatmeal Stout_ on tap, for the first time in six years. It joins the _Brown Ale_, _IPA_,_ Red Ale, __Blueberry Wheat_, and _Cream Ale_ on tap (and most are also available in growlers). Keep an eye on their [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/Rogues_Roost) for the up-to-date growler list, as well as their continuing Brewmasters events.

• We forgot to mention this last week, but better late than never, especially when it involves great beer! At this year's [Saint John Beer Fest](https://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest) (held on Saturday, April 5th), the crowd selected the Best of Show beer for the event... the winner was [Hammond River Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) _Hop Flash IPA_! Owner/brewer Shane Steeves was surprised, yet extremely grateful, at being singled out among other great beers. Congratulations, Shane!

• We mentioned in a [previous Friday post](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/friday-wrap-up-5/) that Picaroons was holding a [Prohibition Repeal Party](https://www.facebook.com/events/210998705776641/) at the [Capital Complex](https://www.facebook.com/thecapitalcomplex) in Fredericton tomorrow, featuring a tap-takeover of their 12 draught lines. They've released which beers will be present - many of their regular releases will be there, along with their Yippee IPA dry-hopped with Cascade, Amarillo and Willamette, and their Best Bitter infused with Fuggle hops (thanks to the use of [Randall the Enamel Animal](http://www.dogfish.com/company/tangents/randall-the-enamel-animal.htm)). Check out our previous post and the event page for more info!

• Continuing with Picaroons reminders, if you still plan on sending in a picture of your kitty for their **Melonhead Cat Contest**, deadline for the hi-res pictures to be [emailed](mailto:MelonheadContest<at>gmail.com) is next Thursday, April 24th. More details in our earlier post [here](http://atlanticcanadabeerblog.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/friday-wrap-up-5/).

• The next [Rockbottom](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) Beer Dinner is scheduled for April 29th at 6pm. Featuring three courses paired with three beers, it's a great opportunity to chat with Brewmaster Greg Nash about beer, food, and life in general. This month's dinner will be Sweet Potato Gnocchi paired with their _Bigwater Brown_, Stout Braised Lamb Shank (_Jacktar Stout_), and Unbaked Peanut Butter Cheesecake (_Fathom IPA_). Call the pub for tickets, but act quickly, as its already half sold-out. While there, you can try their [Thulsa Doom DIPA](http://rockbottombrewpub.blogspot.ca/2014/04/thulsa-doom-dipa.html), and their _Galaxy India Pale Lager_ SMaSH should be on tap by then as well.

• A friendly reminder that the [Beerthief Private Beer Order](http://www.beerthief.ca/beer-offerings/offering-11-wold-top-and-orkney-breweries) for [Wold Top](http://www.woldtopbrewery.co.uk/) and [Orkney](http://www.sinclairbreweries.co.uk/home.html) is closing this Sunday, be sure to email in your requests before then to take part. Mike Buhler will also be leading a [Beer and Tulip River Cruise](http://www.beerthief.ca/beer-events/march-2015-beer-tulip-river-cruise) in March of 2015, visiting Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brussels, Ghent and more. Check out this [flyer](http://www.beerthief.ca/wp-content/uploads/beer-tulip-river-cruise.pdf) for more details.

• Finally, in case you missed yesterday's post on the recently-opened [Big Axe Brewery](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery) in Nackawic... well, they're now open! You can stop by the brewery/B&B on 519 Otis Dr. for growler fills of their first two beers, Chantarelle Cream Ale and Double Bit IPA, Mondays to Saturdays from 12 pm - 8 pm. You should also see their beers popping up in bars/restaurants in the area, including the [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/) in Fredericton, in the near future. We'll keep you updated on their development!

• Tickets are now on sale for the [Inaugural ](http://www.glasgowsquare.com/best_pizza_competition.html)[Pictou County Pizza Competition](http://www.glasgowsquare.com/best_pizza_competition.html), Saturday, April 26th, Glasgow Square, New Glasgow. Along with the chance to try six different Pictou County-style pizzas (from Cafe Italia, Crown Pizza Pictou, East Side Pizza, Sam’s Pizza (Stellarton), Sam’s Pizza (Trenton), Ted’s Pizza), attendees will receive two glasses of [Uncle Leo's](http://uncleleosbrewery.ca/) beer. Tickets are available at various outlets in New Glasgow and Pictou.
