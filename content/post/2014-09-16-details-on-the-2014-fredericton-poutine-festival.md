The second annual [Fredericton Poutine Festival](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonPoutineFestival) will be held on Saturday, November 8th, 2014 at the [Delta Fredericton Hotel](https://www.deltahotels.com/Hotels/Delta-Fredericton). After selling out last year's inaugural event, organizer Lloyd Chambers (also the brains behind the [Fredericton Craft Beer Festival](https://www.facebook.com/FrederictonCraftBeerFestival)) decided to make this year's festival even better, by increasing both the number of poutine establishments and beers available.

Like last year, there will be two sessions, one in the afternoon from 1:30 pm - 4:00 pm, and a 19+ session in the evening from 6:00 pm - 9:00 pm (with a VIP starting time of 5:00 pm).

Tickets for the afternoon session are $25 per person, with children 12 years and under being admitted for free. This session will include unlimited samples of poutine, along with free soda, juice and water.

The evening session also includes unlimited poutine and soft drinks, but brings beer, cider and mead into the mix as well! For this session, there are four different ticket options:

"Regular, no beer" - $30, same as the afternoon session

"Regular" - $40 per, includes four 4 oz beer/cider/mead samples, plus a tasting glass

"Beer Experience" - $50 per, includes twelve 4 oz beer/cider/mead samples, plus a tasting glass

"VIP" - $60 per, includes eight 8 oz beer/cider/mead samples, early entry to the festival by one hour, and a special 8 oz tasting glass

This year, five different establishments will be serving up two different types of poutine each. Those participating include [James Joyce Irish Pub](https://www.facebook.com/JamesJoyceFredericton), [Johnny 5's Burger and Fries](https://www.facebook.com/johnny5sburgers), [King Street Ale House](http://thekingstreetalehouse.ca/), [reLiSH Gourmet Burgers](http://relishyou.ca/), and [Smoke's Poutinerie](http://smokespoutinerie.com/).

Now, on to the beer (and more)! The tentative list includes no less than ten breweries from New Bunswick, including [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery), [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307), [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery), [Moosehead](http://moosehead.ca/), [Brasseurs du Petit-Sault](http://brasseurspetitsault.com/), [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/), [Railcar](http://railcarbrewing.com/), [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/), [Shiretown](http://www.shiretownbeer.com/), and [Sunset Heights Meadery](https://www.facebook.com/SunsetHeightsMeadery). Quebec breweries [Unibroue](http://www.unibroue.com/) and [Le Naufrageur](http://www.lenaufrageur.com/) will also be pouring, as well as European beer [McClelland Premium Imports](http://www.mcclellandbeers.ca/), so there will be plenty - over 15 products - available to sample! Note that additional beer tickets will not be sold at the event.

There will be ballots during the event for all ticket-holders to vote on a "Best of Show" for both poutine and beer, cider or mead.

All tickets will go on sale today at 2:00 p.m., and can be purchased [online](https://fredpoutinefest14.eventbrite.ca/) at that time. Like last year's festival, there will only be a total of 450 tickets sold between the two sessions, so don't wait to get yours! The Delta Fredericton is offering a reduced-rate for festival-goers; you can make a reservation for Saturday night [here](https://www.deltahotels.com/Groups/Delta-Fredericton-Groups/Fredericton-Poutine-Festival2).

Stay tuned over the coming weeks, as we'll try to keep you updated to the finalized list of beers that will be pouring at the festival, as well as a possible ticket giveaway! We hope to see you there!
