[![](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/glutenberg.jpg)](http://acbeerblog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/glutenberg.jpg)I received the following press release from Garrison Brewing earlier today:

**Garrison partners with Quebec brewer to offer gluten-free beer **

HALIFAX, NS – October 3, 2012– Garrison Brewing has joined forces with the Montreal-based craft brewery Brasseurs Sans Gluten (BSG) to offer Atlantic Canadians’ a gluten-free beer option.

Glutenberg Blonde Ale, now available at select NSLCs, is made from the gluten-free grain millet and boasts distinct floral hops, white pepper and lemon zest aromas. It was developed over a period of one year and is one of only a few beer options for Canadians living with Celiac disease or other forms of gluten intolerance. It’s estimated that 1 per cent of Canadians are affected by Celiac Disease and many times that number has varying levels of gluten intolerance.

"I know personally and professionally how important this market is becoming,” explains Garrison President Brian Titus. “We were so impressed when sampling the BSG line and meeting the folks behind this young company. I thought to myself, ‘Finally, a gluten-free offering with full, craft beer flavour!’”

Only in business one year, BSG has already won gold, silver and bronze at the 2012 World Beer Cup for gluten-free beers. The recipes were developed over a 12 month period and they are the only microbrewery in the country that brews and bottles their beers in a 100 per cent gluten-free environment.

“Garrison has been in business for many years and knows the market and the people,” says David Cayer, co-founder and chief marketing officer for BSG. “When we met at the Canadian Brewing Awards in Montreal, we felt there was a natural connection between our teams and we knew we could trust them to represent our product.”

Glutenberg Blonde is now on sale at NSLC stores in Nova Scotia and PEILCC stores in Prince Edward Island. The process is underway to make the beer available in New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador.

_Editor's note_:  _Here are the tasting notes that accompanied the press release:_


<blockquote>The mouth bursts with white flowers, citrus and spicy flavours. With just a hint of bitterness to balance out the sweetness of the millet and the corn, this beer offers a truly refreshing taste.</blockquote>
