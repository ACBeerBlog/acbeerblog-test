Hello beer fans! Another busy week in Atlantic Canadian Beer News.



	
  * [Picaroons](http://www.picaroons.ca/)' Easter Keg Hunt is on now! Search around downtown Fredericton, NB for the 4 painted kegs and snap a picture of yourself to win a prize. Check their [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151373650202005) for more details.

	
  * Also, with their upcoming [Melonhead release](pic.twitter.com/L1YQVJ2ONO), they are looking for a photogenic kitty to grace the label. Email them a picture of your favourite cat, and it could be famous!

	
  * [Big Spruce Brewing](http://www.facebook.com/BigSpruceBrewing) in Nyanza, NS is ready to open, and is having a pair of parties to mark the occasion. [Saturday April 6th 4-8pm](https://www.facebook.com/events/152617354904846) at the Bras d'Or Yacht Club in Baddeck, and Saturday April 20th 7pm at The Wooden Monkey in Dartmouth (upstairs at the Alderney Ferry Terminal). Come out to support the Atlantic Provinces' newest brewery!

	
  * Last week, [Propeller Brewing Co](http://drinkpropeller.ca/) released a new [1L flip-top Growler](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1015149192498923), for when you only want one litre of your favourite beer. Fill it with their Double IPA or current One Hit Wonder Black IPA (only available in growlers at the Prop Shoppe on Gottingen in Halifax for a limited time).

	
  * Not to be outdone, [Garrison Brewing Co](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) released their own version, a[ 1L "Growlito"](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151569408546153) this week. Think of these as a three-pack of beer, for when you have to be up early the next morning :)

	
  * Garrison has released their 2013 Ol' Fog Burner, as well the 2012 Barrel-Aged version, which spent 9 months in [Glenora Distillery](http://www.glenoradistillery.com/) barrels. Only 1000 bottles of these available, so make your way to the brewery to pick them up.

	
  * Following up on a recent post, Mike Buhler has launched [Beerthief.ca](http://www.beerthief.ca/), complete with [forums](http://www.beerthief.ca/forum/) for chatting about the beer scene in Newfoundland, as well as homebrewing and everything else. Keep up to date with the next offerings from the Newfoundland Beer Club.

	
  * The [Saint John Beer Fest](http://www.facebook.com/SaintJohnBeerFest) (April 13 at Market Square in Saint John) VIP tickets are sold out, but there are still regular tickets available through the Harbour Station. We are eagerly awaiting the brewery and beer list, and will release our interview with them next week.

	
  * [Shiretown Beer](http://www.facebook.com/shiretown)'s Blonde du Quai is now available in 500mL bottles. Since their move to Charlo in January, they've been busy, including "Best of the Fest" at the Fredericton Craft Beer Festival. Congratulations and keep up the great work, Derek and Tim! You're helping folks in Northern New Brunswick drink great beer.
