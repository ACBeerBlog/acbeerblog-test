As per [Garrison's Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/garrisonbrewing), the 2012 version of their 3 Fields Harvest Ale will be available starting next Friday.  Hops from 4 different Nova Scotia fields, Meander River Farms, Wysmykal Farm, Ross Farm Museum and Fiddlehop Farms were used in the production of the brew.  [The beer is described on the Garrison site as](http://adminpanel.garrisonbrewing.com/accounts/garrison/websites/garrisonbrewing.com/module_files/brewery/beer_group/4/beer/22.pdf):


<blockquote>Deep golden colour.  It has a complex combination of floral, lemon and pine aromas, featuring a juicy citrus mouth feel with a hint of pine and ginger and lingering hop finish.</blockquote>


The brew comes in at 6.4% ABV and at 39 IBUs.

If you haven't been to the [Garrison website lately](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) it has been re-done and is looking good!
