• After an official announcement and press release from Sebastien Roy of [Fils du Roy](http://distilleriefilsduroy.com/), we have more information on the **Acadian Nut Brown** style we mentioned [last week](http://acbeerblog.ca/2017/06/09/friday-wrap-up-20170609/). Several Acadian breweries united to create a "100% Acadian beer" to mark the 170th anniversary of the poem "Evangeline", by Henry Longfellow. The style has many descriptors, including "caramel, light coffee, hazelnut, chocolate, fruity, molasses, and licorice". We already wrote up [Petit-Sault](http://petitsault.com/en/)'s entry, _La Madoueska_, last week, but there's others to mention as well, as several breweries in Atlantic Canada are participating. Fils du Roy has released their Evangeline (7% ABV), [Flying Boats](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Boats-Brewing/1580598582194710) their _General's Armada_ (5.5% ABV, 23 IBUs), and [Savoie's](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Savoies-Brewhouse/1617785005132093?fref=ts) has a _Nut-Brown Ale_. As well, [Acadie-Broue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acadie-Broue/176759632361301) is including their previously-released _La Bringue_.
