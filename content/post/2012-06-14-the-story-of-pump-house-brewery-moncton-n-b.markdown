The story of the Pump House Brewery is the story of a dream come true.  The husband and wife team of Shaun and Lilia Fraser opened the Pump House in September 1999 fulfilling Shaun's long term dream of opening his own brewery.  Shaun actually appeared on the "Thrill of a Lifetime" television show in the 1980s when he was given the chance to brew beer at a Labatt's plant after his inability to land a job with any of the big breweries.  While in didn't turn into a full time gig (Shaun didn't have the food science or chemical engineering background required to be a brew master at the plant;  his education is as a Geologist) it started him off on his journey to owning his own brewery and eventually winning Canadian Brewery of the Year.   I sat down with Shaun for a conversation at the brewery on Mill Road in Moncton to complete this post.

_Background_
As is often the case, Shaun spent a few years homebrewing before brewing commercially.  Over the three to four years he was homebrewing before getting his first chance to brew professionally, he completed 100s of batches. His first professional brewing job was with HansHaus Brewery in Dieppe, N.B. in the late 1980s.  The German who hired Shaun had received his Doctorate of Brewing Science at one of the best brewing schools in the world.  After a couple of years working with the brewery (it closed shortly after Shaun left), he started to brew at Fat Tuesday's in Moncton.

After a couple of years of all malt brewing, Shaun moved into the equipment side of things and worked for Charlottetown Metal Products (now known as DME).  He eventually went to work for another company in the U.S. where he successfully gained over 50% market share of the craft beer equipment market in New England.  He eventually moved into foreign and difficult installations world wide and helped open breweries in Ireland, England, Palestine, Israel and Kazakhstan.  It was while setting up a brewery in Kazakhstan, that Shaun met his future wife Lilia.  Lilia came to Moncton with Shaun on a 3 month vacation and decided to stay.  Shaun showed her the beer industry and [Lilia did all of the financials](http://www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=823637412&targetid=profile) for the business plan for Pump House Brewery (Lilia had worked as both a Manufacturing Engineer and Undercover Policy Officer in Kazakhstan).  Shaun is the idea guy and Lilia looks after the details.

The name Pump House was chosen to reflect Shaun's role as a fireman.  Shaun retired from his role as a Captain this past November after 27 and a half years of service as a fireman.

_Expansion
_In 2004, a new brewery on Mill Road in Moncton with accompanying restaurant, the[ Barnyard BBQ](http://www.barnyardbbq.ca/), was opened.  Lilia was responsible for the design of the location and overseas all operations at both restaurants while Shaun looks after the brewery.

The original Pump House location at 5 Orange Lane focuses on the smaller batches, creating 8 HLs at a time.  The larger brewery located on Mill Road in Moncton produces 24 HL / batch.  Annual volume is approximately 5000 HL.

The brewery on Mill Road is as advanced as you'll see for a brewery this size in North America.  It has a bottle washer, tunnel pasteurizer, flash pasteurizer, an EBI, and a FT50 to name a few of the features you likely won't see in comparable breweries.

_Future Plans
_There are no immediate expansion plans for the brewery other than the addition of outdoor fermenters.  This is due in large part to the much longer conditioning time required for the Premium Lager that came out late last year (the lager takes 8 weeks as opposed to 2 to 3 weeks for the ales).

Shaun and Lilia planted a vineyard three years ago near Magnetic Hill and are planning on producing wine within the next three years.  They are also planning on getting into distilling within the next two years.

_Distribution
_Pump House beer is currently available in all provinces other than Quebec (due to inflated fees charged to protect local breweries).  By province, New Brunswick accounts for the largest percentage of sales followed by Alberta and Nova Scotia.

Blueberry is the top selling beer followed by Cadian Cream Ale and Fire Chief's Red Ale while the still relatively new Premium Lager is gaining in sales.  Approximately 70% of their sales is in bottled beer as opposed to draft accounts.

Shaun and Lilia are looking to expand their premium line and also to start offering different seasonal beers in either bottles or cans.     Pump House does have a canning line in place but it has not gone into production as of yet (the machine they have can package 150 cans / minute).  They are planning on offering Blueberry and Thai Wheat in cans by this Fall.    They also plan to offer a variety 12 pack in the foreseeable future.

Pump House currently has over 100 draft accounts and kegs can also be ordered for special events and delivered to various parts of New Brunswick.

_The Beer
_Here's a description of each beer taken directly from the [Pump House website](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/beer):

Year Round Beers:


<blockquote>Blueberry Ale - Blonde coloured ale with the wonderful essence of fresh blueberries. Sweet flavours of peppery blueberries, malts and spicy hops make this one a winner all the way. A one-of-a-kind refresher.

Cadian Cream Ale - A golden coloured ale lending itself to the wonderful malty aromas layered with just a kiss of spicy hops for a clean, smooth finish that will keep you coming back for more.

Fire Chief's Red Ale - A deep tawny reddish hued Irish-inspired ale with a lingering nut-like maltiness. Very lightly hopped with a pleasant estery fruitiness expiring to wonderfully smooth finish. Slainte!

Scotch Ale - Deep brown-amber coloured with a rich smokey aroma. Flavours of caramel, chocolate and peated malts. With it's silky smooth, lightly smokey, roasty character it is a fantastic gold medal winning example of the style.

S.O.B. (Special Old Bitter) - A deep honey-coloured unfiltered west coast style session beer with the classic fresh aromatic hop bouquet mingling with malty undertones for excellent balance finishing with a pleasant lingering bitterness. A great thirst quencher or the perfect buffer with spicy foods!

Pump House Premium Lager - A tribute to the Reinheitsgebot (beer purity law) of 1516, brewed using just barley, hops, yeast and water. Cold aged and matured for more than six weeks, there are no adjuncts, or artificial carbonation - resulting in a 100% natural lager.
