Happy Friday! We've got a summary of last weekend's ACBAs, plus lots of new brews, so let's get right to it!

• Last weekend's [Atlantic Canadian Beer Awards](https://www.facebook.com/BeerAwardsAtlantic) celebrated the high quality beers and ciders in our region. We reached out to ACBA organizer Mark DeWolf (Manager - Custom Content, Food & Drink at The Chronicle Herald) for his thoughts on the event:


"We were very pleased with the number of entries and overall quality of the beer and ciders entered into this year's competition. This year's Atlantic Canadian Beer Awards drew over 200 product submissions from more than 30 breweries and cideries from across Atlantic Canada. With 21 different producers picking up an award, it was clear that there is a high level of brewing and cider making in all corners of the region.  It was great seeing some old favourites and some new surprises take home awards. As an organizer, you can never predict what products and producers will win awards, all we can do is ensure that there is an equal opportunity for all the participants. To that end, the BJCP judges and volunteers should be commended. They were exceptionally professional in the manner with which they carried out their duties. Congratulations, of course, goes out to [Garrison Brewing Company](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) for winning their title as **Brewery of the Year**, [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/) from New Brunswick for winning our newly created** Cidery of the Year** award, [Rockbottom Brewpub](http://rockbottombrewpub.ca/) for winning the title of **Brewpub of the Year** and [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/) for collecting the title of **Beer of the Year** for their exceptional _Box Cutter IPA_. We look forward to a bigger and better competition in 2016."

Congratulations once again to the winners, and to all of our local breweries and cider houses for continuing to step up their game and improving the environment for local beer fans. Now on to the rest of our scheduled program...

• We finally have some news on the new IPA from [Pump House](http://beer.pumphousebrewery.ca/); _SPCA IPA_ was brewed in support of the [Greater Moncton SPCA](https://www.facebook.com/gmspca.spagm?fref=ts), and was officially released at the brewery yesterday. Heavily-hopped (with almost four times the amount of hops as their regular-release IPA) with a blend of "atypical hops", this amber-coloured beer has an aroma of "grapefruit and citrus, paired with subtle hints of dark berries and a touch of phenol", according to the brewery. The bitterness comes across as intense, yet with a "pleasingly palatable" flavour. Weighing in at 7% ABV and 50 IBUs, it's available now in 500 mL bottles, exclusively at the brewpub in Moncton; a portion of the proceeds from sales will go to the GMSPCA. And Pump House's _Pumpkin Ale_ is out again; you can find it on tap at the brewpub, and possibly at select accounts in the province.

• The first annual [Fredericton Cider Fest](https://www.facebook.com/events/516495658518745/) is being held tomorrow at [Brewbakers](http://brewbakers.ca/), starting at 12 or 1 pm (depending on your ticket). Featuring approximately 25 different ciders from six producers (including Fredericton's own [Red Rover](http://www.redroverbrew.com/), winners of Cider House of the Year at last weekend's ACBAs), the sold-out VIP tickets allow early entry at noon, as well as access to an info session, but there ARE still some regular-entry tickets left, which include unlimited samples and a special tasting glass. Red Rover will have two different cask ciders, one of which is their _Hop Back in Time_, a 7% ABV semi-dry cider that has been dry-hopped with a secret blend of varieties. With earthy and citrus notes in the nose, including hints of apple, the hops mix perfectly in the flavours to provide a slight bitterness and grassy notes on the finish. This one-off was brewed specifically for Cider Fest, so be sure to get your tickets if you haven't already, so that you don't miss out! For more info, check out our [earlier post](http://acbeerblog.ca/2015/09/04/friday-wrap-up-20150904/).

• [Railcar Brewing](http://railcarbrewing.com/) will be celebrating their [1st Birthday](https://www.facebook.com/events/1006778959374440/) on Saturday, October 31st. Drop by the brewery from 12 - 10 pm for cake and special pricing on pints and pitchers; the first 50 customers will also receive a free growler with purchased fill. Railcar has also just released_ Shogomac Stout_, brewed with plenty of dark, roasted malts for a jet-black colour and coffee/chocolate aromas and flavours. Hopped with two additions of [Southan Farms](http://www.southanfarms.net/) **Goldings** and one of **Fuggles** (to a total of 44 IBUs), it comes in at 5.8% ABV; you can find it now at the brewery and the James Joyce in Fredericton.

• Speaking of Railcar, they've had a guest brewer drop by and brew up a batch of Pale Ale, which is currently being poured as a guest tap at the brewery. Al Bannister is the owner of [River Valley Micro](https://www.facebook.com/River-Valley-Micro-214953222029168/), a homebrew shop in Woodstock, NB, who plans on opening his own brewery sometime in 2016. He recently brewed his _Trout Pout Pale Ale_ on Railcar's system, a 6.6% ABV and 43 IBUs beer hopped with **Amarillo** and **Centennial**. Bannister hopes to brew a Blonde Ale and American IPA (both with hops from Southan Farms) at Railcar in the near future, with other styles to follow. Drop by Railcar if you're in the area, and get a sneak peek from this upcoming brewery!

• The season's creeping to a close, but there's still some Harvest beers hitting the shelves! [Hell Bay](http://www.hellbaybrewing.com/) has just released their _High Tide Harvest Ale_, hopped entirely with locally-grown hops from [High Tide Hops Farm](https://twitter.com/hightidehops) in Dayspring, NS. This 5% ABV ale showcases a "rich, malty body", and "peppery notes" from the European yeast strain used for fermentation. It's currently available at the brewery for growler fills, as well as on tap at [Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) and [White Point Beach Resort](https://www.facebook.com/whitepointbeachresort), and this weekend's sold out [Celtic Oktoberfest](http://celticoktoberfest.ca/).

• [Yellowbelly Brewery](http://www.yellowbellybrewery.com/) in St John's is celebrating Oktoberfest with their newest beer ... _Oktoberfest_! This is the first time YB has brewed a lager, taking a detour from their standard ale offerings. Brewed in the traditional [Fest Bier](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style03.php#1b) style, this 6% ABV grain bill features Pilsner, Munich and Vienna malts, and was hopped with **Styrian Goldings** and **Saphir** to about 28 IBUs, and then allowed to ferment and condition cold for a month before hitting the taps. The resultant beer is very smooth with a nice noble hop character to complement the malt base, and as such is very easy to drink. And while at the pub, be sure to grab some of their _Deep South_, now in bottles to take away.

• [Petite Riviere Vineyards](http://www.petiterivierevineyards.ca/) has released a new cider in their Stutz lineup: _Stutz Chai Spice_. Featuring a special blend of Black Pepper, Cardamon, Cinnamon, Ginger, Madagascar Vanilla, and Star Anise, steeped in the cider post-fermentation. The base cider is 100% Annapolis Valley pressed apples, and uses the same blend as their standard _Stutz_, but with a lower residual sugar level. The spicing level is quite present, while allowing the bright apple notes and typical cider crispness to shine through. In addition to the pleasant flavour and aromas from the Chai spice blend, there may also be some relaxation and digestion benefits to the spices. The _Chai Spice_ is available at the [NSLC](http://www.mynslc.com/Pages/advancedSearch.aspx?k=Stutz), along with the standard and _Blueberry_ blends, as well as their Farmers' market booths and shop in [Petite Riviere](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Petite+Rivi%C3%A8re+Vineyards/@44.253782,-64.4794825,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7a6488d1b164d1d6?sa=X&ved=0CIYBEPwSMA1qFQoTCNq4iobL2MgCFc22HgodBBoKxg).

• [Grimross](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grimross-Brewing-Co/110264115801307) has released their _Singel_, another beer in their Belgian Abbey series. Brewed as a low-alcohol (4.8% ABV) and easy-drinking, flavourful ale, this beer is along the lines of what the Abbey monks brew for their own consumption, instead of for sale to the public. Very dry, and with a "clean malt aroma and crisp light mouthfeel", it's similar to their previously-released _Monk's Choice_ earlier this year. Look for it on tap at the brewery, and at better beer establishments in New Brunswick.

• There's been rumours for months now, but [TrailWay](https://www.facebook.com/trailwaybrewing) confirmed late last week that they will be undergoing a move and major expansion over the coming months. They have already ordered their 10 BBL (310 gallons, or ~11 hL) steam-fired system from [DME](https://www.facebook.com/DMEBrewingSolutions), and will be opening on Fredericton's north side sometime next spring. We'll have more info for you as progress continues... cheers to more TW beer 2016!

• Don't forget today is the first of the [Meet Your Makers](https://www.facebook.com/events/939778942761221/) tap takeovers at the [James Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/FoodatTheCrownDowntown); [Big Axe](https://www.facebook.com/BigAxeBrewery) will be on hand starting at 7:30 pm with ten taps pouring, including their newest beer, _Anaphylactic Ale_. Brewed with 3 kg of the rooftop honey produced on top of the Crowne Plaza, it also features the addition of lemon thyme that was picked locally at Big Axe. It comes in at 6.5% ABV and 26 IBUs. After its launch at the James Joyce, it will also be available at the [Saint John Ale House](http://www.saintjohnalehouse.com/) and [Tide and Boar](http://www.tideandboar.com/) in Moncton.

• As part of tomorrow's [City Harvest](http://www.ilovelocalhfx.ca/v1/), [Garrison](http://www.garrisonbrewing.com/) has invited the crew from [Morris East](http://morriseast.com/) and their portable wood-fired pizza oven from 10am -4pm to share some great pizza and beer. And to complement that already-winning combination, [Miller's Kettle Corn](http://www.millerskettlecorn.ca/) will also be in the house. To celebrate, Garrison has created a special one-off cask of _Sour Cherry Stout_. They filled a cask with their _Martello Stout_, and used the juice from sour cherries to prime/condition the cask. There is only one of these casks, and is therefore only available for onsite consumption. Drop by between 10am to 4pm to enjoy the full pizza, popcorn, and beer experience. And speaking of Garrison, drop by [harbourstone sea grill & pour house](https://www.facebook.com/HarbourstoneGrill) to get a taste of the _Gastronome IPA_ beer they brewed for them, which debuted last night. Also, check I Love Local's [page](http://www.ilovelocalhfx.ca/v1/) (and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ILOVELOCALHFX)) for a full list of City Harvest activities across the HRM, many more of them featuring beer, including a discount on growler fills at [North Brewing](http://www.northbrewing.ca/).

That's it for this week! [Hammond River](https://www.facebook.com/hammondriverbrewery) has just kegged up their latest batch of _Too Hop to Handle_, their 8.4% ABV and 162 IBUs (calc) DIPA; look for it at their tap accounts any day now. And keep an eye open for a special aged cask of their _Sterke Monnik Belgian Quad_, being tapped at [Port City Royal](http://www.portcityroyal.com/) Saturday, October 31st. [Bad Apple Brewhouse](http://badapplebrewhouse.ca/) teased a picture of them dry-hopping their latest batch of _Mosaic Double IPA_, we expect it to be released again in November. All of the proceeds from this beer are donated to local support groups for families and those living with Mosaic Down Syndrome, including funding for attendance to [Brigadoon Village](http://www.brigadoonvillage.org/). [Firkinstein Brewing](https://www.facebook.com/FirkinStein-Brewing-754150891380564/) have also begun selling at the [Lunenburg Farmers' Market](http://lunenburgfarmersmarket.ca/) Thursday mornings, in addition to their [Hubbards Farmers’ Market](http://hubbardsbarn.org/farmers-market/) stall on Saturdays. While they may not be at this coming week's market (Oct 29) due to space availability, they will back permanently going forward. Look for them on tap at [Bridgewater Local Tap House](http://bridgewaterlocals.ca/) and the [Grand Banker](http://www.grandbanker.com/) in Lunenburg very soon! [Sea Level Brewing](http://www.sealevelbrewing.com/) has brought back their _Port in the Storm Porter_ for another year, available now at the [Port Pub](http://www.theportpub.com/), brewery, and private stores; their _Punkin' Grinner Ale_ should be out now as well. And [Bar Stillwell](http://www.barstillwell.com/) has announced that their Second Anniversary party will be taking place Sunday, November 15th. No tickets are required, just show up for some special beers they've been cellaring, and some great food to match. We'll have more details on the party once they are available, including a new beer release or two.
